# Harvesting
The harvesting of beans can be summarized in a few simple steps:

1. Timing: Determining the right time to harvest your beans is crucial. Generally, bush beans are ready for harvest when the pods are plump, firm, and have reached their full size.

2. Preparation: Before harvesting, equip yourself with a pair of sharp scissors or garden shears. 

3. Harvesting: Gently hold the stem of the bean plant and use your scissors or shears to cut the bean pods just above the base of the plant.

4. Collection: As you harvest, collect the freshly cut bean pods in a basket or container. 

5. Repeat Harvests: Beans are often harvested in multiple stages. Check your plants regularly, as new pods will continue to develop and mature.

6. Post-Harvest: Once you have gathered your beans, store them in a cool and dry place. 
# Pruning 
Pruning beans involves cutting the top of the main stem to encourage bushier growth. Remove side shoots (suckers) to focus energy on bean production. Trim diseased or damaged parts. Pruning is optional but can benefit pole beans or for a more controlled plant shape.


##  What time  is best  for pruning?
The best time for pruning beans is when the plants reach a height of 6-8 inches (15-20 cm). Prune by pinching off the top of the main stem and removing side shoots (suckers). Timely pruning helps promote bushier growth and higher bean production.
# Crop Distance
Here are some general guidelines for spacing bean plants:

1. Row spacing: The spacing between rows can vary based on the growth habit of the bean variety and the available machinery for maintenance and harvesting. For bush beans (determinate varieties), a row spacing of about 45 to 60 centimeters (18 to 24 inches) is common. For pole beans (indeterminate varieties), which require support structures like trellises or poles, a row spacing of about 90 to 120 centimeters (36 to 48 inches) is typical.

2. Plant spacing within rows: The spacing between individual bean plants within a row can also vary based on the variety and desired plant density. For bush beans, a spacing of about 10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6 inches) between plants within a row is common. For pole beans, a spacing of about 15 to 20 centimeters (6 to 8 inches) between plants is typical.

3. Plant density: The desired plant density will depend on factors such as the variety, available resources, and management practices. In general, plant densities for beans can range from 15,000 to 30,000 plants per hectare (6,000 to 12,000 plants per acre). The specific plant density will depend on the desired yield and the spacing between rows and plants within rows.
