# What's Avocado?
The avocado (Persea americana) is a medium-sized, evergreen tree in the laurel family (Lauraceae). It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated in Mesoamerica more than 5,000 years ago. Then as now it was prized for its large and unusually oily fruit. The tree likely originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala .Its fruit, sometimes also referred to as an alligator pear or avocado pear, is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed. Avocado trees are partly self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain consistent fruit output. Avocados are presently cultivated in the tropical and Mediterranean climates of many countries. Mexico is the world's leading producer of avocados as of 2020, supplying nearly 30% of the global harvest in that year.

# How to grow Avocado
Growing avocado trees from seed can be a fun and rewarding project. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to grow avocado:

1. Obtain an avocado seed: After enjoying an avocado, carefully remove the seed from the center. 

2. Prepare the seed: Insert three to four toothpicks into the seed's sides, about halfway up. 

3. Suspend the seed in water: Place the seed with the toothpicks in a glass or jar filled with water. 

4. Find a warm and bright spot: Place the glass or jar in a warm location with indirect sunlight, such as a windowsill. 

5. Change the water regularly: Every few days, change the water in the glass or jar to prevent mold growth. 

6. Wait for germination: It may take anywhere from two to eight weeks for the seed to sprout. 

7. Transplant the sprouted seed: Once the sprout is around 6-7 inches tall and has developed roots, carefully transplant it into a pot filled with well-draining soil. 

8. Provide proper care: Place the potted avocado plant in a sunny location where it receives at least six hours of sunlight daily.
Fertilize with a balanced houseplant fertilizer every few months.

9. Monitor growth and repot if needed: As your avocado plant grows, you may need to repot it into a larger container to accommodate its roots. 

10. Be patient and enjoy the process: Growing an avocado tree from seed can take several years before it bears fruit.
# Light
They prefer full sun, meaning they should get at least six hours of direct sunlight each day. However, some varieties can tolerate partial shade if necessary. The amount of light an avocado tree needs will depend on the variety you have planted in your garden or yard and the strength of the sun in your area.
# Soil
Avocado trees can grow well in a wide range of soils. The ideal soil for most varieties is loose, loamy, or sandy with a slightly acidic to neutral pH, between 5 and 7.
# Water
This means that approximately 70 litres of applied fresh ground or surface water are required to grow one avocado. Of course, the amount of applied water needed to grow one avocado is dependent on where in the world it is grown.
It takes a lot of water to produce avocados. On average, 2,000 liters of water (about 528 gallons) are needed to produce a kilo of avocados (about 2.2 pounds).
# Temperature and Humidity
Avocado trees do best at moderately warm temperatures (60 F to 85 F) with moderate humidity.
The ideal relative humidity range for the majority of avocado varieties is between 45 to 65%, give or take 5%. Just as in extremely hot conditions, very dry air also causes avocado leaf stomata to reduce function for optimal tree health and fruit set.
Remember that avocado trees do best at moderately warm temperatures (60 F to 85 F) with moderate humidity. They can tolerate temperatures, once established, of around 28 F to 32 F with minimal damage.
# Fertilizers
Avocado trees benefit from a fertilizer containing equal nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. (such as a 20-20-20 or 20-10-20 formula). You can also use organic fertilizers such as compost or well-rotted manure.
# Possible Disease of Avocado
## Virus
Avocado trees can be affected by several viral diseases. Here are some common viral diseases that can impact avocado trees:

Avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBVd): ASBVd is a small, single-stranded RNA pathogen that causes Avocado Sunblotch Disease. It can lead to symptoms such as yellowing, mottling, and chlorosis of leaves, as well as reduced fruit quality and yield.

Avocado ringspot virus (AvRSV): AvRSV causes ring-shaped or necrotic lesions on the leaves of infected avocado trees. It can also result in reduced fruit size, deformation, and a decline in overall tree health.

Avocado latent virus (ALV): ALV is a common virus found in avocado trees. It generally does not cause severe symptoms but can lead to symptomless infections or mild leaf mottling.

Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV): CMV is a widespread virus that can infect various plant species, including avocado. It can cause mosaic patterns, leaf distortion, and stunted growth in avocado trees.

Tristeza virus (CTV): While primarily known for affecting citrus trees, tristeza virus can also infect avocado trees. It can lead to symptoms such as leaf yellowing, stunted growth, and dieback.

It affects the roots and crown of avocado trees, leading to root rot, wilting, and eventually tree decline or death. Poor drainage and excessive soil moisture can increase the risk of this disease.

Anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.): Anthracnose is caused by several species of the Colletotrichum fungus. It primarily affects the fruit, causing dark, sunken lesions that may expand and rot. In severe cases, it can also affect leaves, twigs, and branches, leading to defoliation and dieback.

Cercospora spot (Cercospora purpurea): Cercospora spot is characterized by the presence of small, dark purple spots on avocado leaves. As the disease progresses, the spots may enlarge and coalesce, leading to defoliation and reduced tree vigor.

Dothiorella canker (Botryosphaeria spp.): Dothiorella canker is caused by several species of the Botryosphaeria fungus. It causes sunken, necrotic lesions on branches and stems, often accompanied by gumming. Severe infections can result in dieback and tree decline.

Verticillium wilt (Verticillium spp.): Verticillium wilt is caused by various species of the Verticillium fungus. It affects the vascular system of avocado trees, leading to wilting, yellowing of leaves, and eventually tree death. The fungus can persist in the soil for long periods, making it challenging to manage.

Brown rot (Phytophthora spp.): Brown rot is caused by several species of the Phytophthora fungus. It primarily affects avocado fruit, causing brown, decayed lesions that can lead to fruit rot and post-harvest losses.
## Bacteria
Avocado trees can be affected by bacterial diseases, although they are less common compared to fungal and viral diseases. Here are some bacterial diseases that can impact avocado trees:

Bacterial canker (Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae): Bacterial canker is caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. It can infect the branches, stems, and fruit of avocado trees, causing sunken cankers, gumming, and dieback. In severe cases, it can result in tree death.

Bacterial black spot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris): Bacterial black spot affects avocado fruit and is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. It causes black, necrotic lesions on the fruit surface, which can lead to fruit rot and post-harvest losses.

Bacterial stem rot (Erwinia spp.): Bacterial stem rot is caused by several species of the Erwinia bacterium. It affects the stems and branches of avocado trees, causing water-soaked lesions, wilting, and eventually, stem collapse.

Bacterial soft rot (Dickeya spp. and Pectobacterium spp.): Bacterial soft rot is caused by various species of the Dickeya and Pectobacterium bacteria. It can affect avocado fruit and causes soft, watery decay, accompanied by an unpleasant odor.

# Toxicity
Avocado contains a toxin called persin, but only certain species of animals are poisoned by persin. While dogs and cats are rarely affected by persin, avocado poisoning can be deadly to birds and large animals (such as cows, goats, sheep).
# Harvesting
Harvesting can be done by hand or by machine. The process begins after tree maturity, which takes three years after planting. The avocados are harvested when fully developed, typically from February to October.
# Pruning
Damaged or dead branches are pruned from avocado trees to increase aesthetic appeal as well as to avoid blocking sunlight to healthy limbs. Tall branches are pruned to encourage growth at a more beneficial height, and long branches are pruned to encourage the direction of energy into fruit rather than longer boughs.
## What is the best time to prune Avocado trees?
The best time for pruning avocado trees is typically during late winter or early spring, similar to apple trees. This is when the tree is still dormant and before new growth begins. Pruning during this time helps promote healthy growth and allows for better shaping and maintenance of the tree. It is important to avoid pruning avocado trees during the fall or summer, as this can disrupt the tree's natural growth cycle and make it more susceptible to disease and pests.
# Crop Distance
The required distance for avocado trees depends on the specific variety being grown and the cultivation practices being employed. Generally, avocado trees should be spaced around 6 to 8 meters (20 to 26 feet) apart in a row and 6 to 9 meters (20 to 30 feet) between rows.

This spacing allows for sufficient airflow, sunlight penetration, and access for management practices such as pruning and harvesting. Avocado trees have a spreading canopy, so providing enough space between trees is important to prevent overcrowding and promote healthy growth.

It is important to consider the specific requirements of the avocado variety being grown, as some may have larger or smaller canopies and may require more or less space accordingly. Local climate conditions, soil fertility, and management practices can also influence the optimal spacing for avocado trees.

Consulting with local agricultural experts or extension offices is recommended to determine the most suitable spacing for avocado trees based on the specific conditions and variety being cultivated.
