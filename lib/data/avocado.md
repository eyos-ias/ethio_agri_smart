# What's Avocado?
The avocado (Persea americana) is a medium-sized, evergreen tree in the laurel family (Lauraceae). It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated in Mesoamerica more than 5,000 years ago. Then as now it was prized for its large and unusually oily fruit. The tree likely originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala .Its fruit, sometimes also referred to as an alligator pear or avocado pear, is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed. Avocado trees are partly self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain consistent fruit output. Avocados are presently cultivated in the tropical and Mediterranean climates of many countries. Mexico is the world's leading producer of avocados as of 2020, supplying nearly 30% of the global harvest in that year.

# HOW to grow Avocado
Growing avocado trees from seed can be a fun and rewarding project. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to grow avocado:

1. Obtain an avocado seed: After enjoying an avocado, carefully remove the seed from the center. 

2. Prepare the seed: Insert three to four toothpicks into the seed's sides, about halfway up. 

3. Suspend the seed in water: Place the seed with the toothpicks in a glass or jar filled with water. 

4. Find a warm and bright spot: Place the glass or jar in a warm location with indirect sunlight, such as a windowsill. 

5. Change the water regularly: Every few days, change the water in the glass or jar to prevent mold growth. 

6. Wait for germination: It may take anywhere from two to eight weeks for the seed to sprout. 

7. Transplant the sprouted seed: Once the sprout is around 6-7 inches tall and has developed roots, carefully transplant it into a pot filled with well-draining soil. 

8. Provide proper care: Place the potted avocado plant in a sunny location where it receives at least six hours of sunlight daily.
Fertilize with a balanced houseplant fertilizer every few months.

9. Monitor growth and repot if needed: As your avocado plant grows, you may need to repot it into a larger container to accommodate its roots. 

10. Be patient and enjoy the process: Growing an avocado tree from seed can take several years before it bears fruit.
# Light
They prefer full sun, meaning they should get at least six hours of direct sunlight each day. However, some varieties can tolerate partial shade if necessary. The amount of light an avocado tree needs will depend on the variety you have planted in your garden or yard and the strength of the sun in your area.
# Soil
Avocado trees can grow well in a wide range of soils. The ideal soil for most varieties is loose, loamy, or sandy with a slightly acidic to neutral pH, between 5 and 7.
# Water
This means that approximately 70 litres of applied fresh ground or surface water are required to grow one avocado. Of course, the amount of applied water needed to grow one avocado is dependent on where in the world it is grown.
It takes a lot of water to produce avocados. On average, 2,000 liters of water (about 528 gallons) are needed to produce a kilo of avocados (about 2.2 pounds).
# Temperature and Humidity
Avocado trees do best at moderately warm temperatures (60 F to 85 F) with moderate humidity.
The ideal relative humidity range for the majority of avocado varieties is between 45 to 65%, give or take 5%. Just as in extremely hot conditions, very dry air also causes avocado leaf stomata to reduce function for optimal tree health and fruit set.
Remember that avocado trees do best at moderately warm temperatures (60 F to 85 F) with moderate humidity. They can tolerate temperatures, once established, of around 28 F to 32 F with minimal damage.
# Fertilizers
Avocado trees benefit from a fertilizer containing equal nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. (such as a 20-20-20 or 20-10-20 formula). You can also use organic fertilizers such as compost or well-rotted manure.
# Pests
  Weevil,
 Scales,
  Thrips,
  Aphids and etc…
# Pesticides
 Thiabendazole – Thiabendazole, also known as the medications Mintezol and Tresaderm, is a fungicide and parasiticide that is used on banana planatations
# Herbs
 Avocado is not typically classified as an herb, but as a fruit tree. However, there are some herbs that are commonly grown alongside avocado trees to provide companion planting benefits. Some common herbs that are often planted near avocado trees include:

1. Basil: Basil is known to repel pests and attract beneficial insects, which can help protect avocado trees from pests and promote pollination.

2. Dill: Dill attracts beneficial insects such as ladybugs and lacewings, which can help control aphids and other pests that may affect avocado trees.

3. Nasturtium: Nasturtiums act as a natural pest deterrent, attracting pests away from avocado trees. They also provide ground cover and help conserve soil moisture.

4. Marigold: Marigolds are known for their pest-repellent properties and can help deter nematodes and other harmful insects from attacking avocado trees.

5. Chives: Chives produce flowers that attract pollinators, which can benefit avocado trees by increasing the chances of successful pollination.

These herbs can be planted in close proximity to avocado trees to create a diverse and beneficial ecosystem that supports the health and growth of the avocado trees.
# Herbicides
Some common herbicides that can be used to control weeds around avocado trees include:

1. Glyphosate: Glyphosate-based herbicides, such as Roundup, are commonly used to control a wide range of weeds. However, caution should be exercised when using glyphosate near avocado trees, as they can be sensitive to this herbicide. Careful application and avoiding direct contact with the avocado tree is important.

2. Triclopyr: Triclopyr-based herbicides, such as Garlon, can be effective in controlling woody and broadleaf weeds around avocado trees. It is important to follow the label instructions and avoid contact with the avocado tree.

3. 2,4-D: 2,4-D is a selective herbicide that targets broadleaf weeds. It can be used to control weeds around avocado trees, but caution should be taken to avoid contact with the avocado tree.

4. Diuron: Diuron-based herbicides, such as Karmex, can be used as a pre-emergent herbicide to control grasses and some broadleaf weeds. It is important to carefully follow the label instructions and avoid direct contact with the avocado tree.

It is important to note that herbicides should be used judiciously and according to label instructions to minimize any potential harm to the avocado tree and surrounding environment. Additionally, it is recommended to consult with a professional or local agricultural extension office for specific herbicide recommendations for avocado trees in your region.
# Toxicity
Avocado contains a toxin called persin, but only certain species of animals are poisoned by persin. While dogs and cats are rarely affected by persin, avocado poisoning can be deadly to birds and large animals (such as cows, goats, sheep).
# Harvesting
Harvesting can be done by hand or by machine. The process begins after tree maturity, which takes three years after planting. The avocados are harvested when fully developed, typically from February to October.
# Pruning
Damaged or dead branches are pruned from avocado trees to increase aesthetic appeal as well as to avoid blocking sunlight to healthy limbs. Tall branches are pruned to encourage growth at a more beneficial height, and long branches are pruned to encourage the direction of energy into fruit rather than longer boughs.
## What is the best time to prune Avocado trees?
Spring
# Crop Distance
The required distance for avocado trees depends on the specific variety being grown and the cultivation practices being employed. Generally, avocado trees should be spaced around 6 to 8 meters (20 to 26 feet) apart in a row and 6 to 9 meters (20 to 30 feet) between rows.

This spacing allows for sufficient airflow, sunlight penetration, and access for management practices such as pruning and harvesting. Avocado trees have a spreading canopy, so providing enough space between trees is important to prevent overcrowding and promote healthy growth.

It is important to consider the specific requirements of the avocado variety being grown, as some may have larger or smaller canopies and may require more or less space accordingly. Local climate conditions, soil fertility, and management practices can also influence the optimal spacing for avocado trees.

Consulting with local agricultural experts or extension offices is recommended to determine the most suitable spacing for avocado trees based on the specific conditions and variety being cultivated.
