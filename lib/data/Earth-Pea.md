# What's Earth Pea?
Earth pea, also known as Lathyrus sativus, is a legume plant that produces edible seeds. It is commonly grown in parts of Asia and Africa as a food crop. Earth pea seeds are rich in protein and can be cooked and consumed like other legumes. However, it is important to note that earth pea contains a neurotoxin called beta-ODAP, which can cause a condition called lathyrism if consumed in large quantities. Lathyrism is characterized by paralysis and other neurological symptoms. Therefore, earth pea should be consumed in moderation and in combination with other foods to avoid the risk of lathyrism.

# How to grow Earth Peas?
To grow Earth peas, also known as field peas or dry peas, follow these steps:

1. Choose the right time: Earth peas are cool-season crops that prefer temperatures between 55-75°F (13-24°C). Plant them in early spring or late summer/early fall, depending on your climate.

2. Prepare the soil: Select a well-draining location with full sun exposure. Loosen the soil using a garden fork or tiller, removing any weeds or rocks. Add organic matter like compost or aged manure to improve soil fertility.

3. Planting: Sow the seeds directly into the prepared soil, about 1-2 inches deep and 2-3 inches apart. Space rows about 18-24 inches apart to allow for proper growth. If planting in rows, consider using trellises or stakes for support.

4. Watering: Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water deeply once or twice a week, depending on rainfall and temperature. Avoid overhead watering to prevent disease.

5. Fertilizing: Earth peas are nitrogen-fixing plants, meaning they can convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form. They generally do not require additional nitrogen fertilization. However, you can apply a balanced organic fertilizer before planting if the soil lacks nutrients.

6. Weed control: Regularly remove weeds around the growing plants to reduce competition for nutrients and water. Mulching can help suppress weed growth.

7. Pests and diseases: Monitor for common pests like aphids, caterpillars, or pea weevils. Use organic pest control methods such as insecticidal soap or neem oil if necessary. Common diseases include powdery mildew and root rot, so ensure good air circulation and avoid overwatering.

8. Harvesting: Earth peas are typically harvested when the pods are fully mature and dry on the plant. The pods should be brown and crispy. Harvest by cutting the entire plant or by picking individual pods. Hang the plants upside down in a dry, well-ventilated area to allow the pods to fully dry.

9. Storing: Once the pods are dry, remove the peas from the pods and store them in airtight containers in a cool, dry place. They can be stored for several months.
# Light
Earth peas require full sun exposure, which means they need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day. This helps them to grow and develop properly.
# Soil
Well-draining soil: Soil that allows water to flow through easily and does not become waterlogged.
- Moisture retention: Soil that can retain some moisture to keep the plant adequately hydrated.
- Fertile soil: Soil that is rich in nutrients, which can be achieved by adding organic matter like compost or aged manure.
- Slightly acidic to neutral pH: Soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is generally preferred, but the Earth Pea can tolerate slightly alkaline soils as well.
# Water
Earth peas require regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Watering them deeply once or twice a week is usually sufficient, depending on the weather and soil conditions. It is important to avoid overwatering as it can lead to root rot and other issues.
# Temperature and Humidity
Earth peas thrive in temperatures between 55°F (13°C) and 75°F (24°C). They prefer moderate humidity levels ranging from 40% to 60%. It is important to provide adequate ventilation to prevent excessive humidity, which can lead to fungal diseases.
# Fertilizers
Earth peas are leguminous plants, which means they have the ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere with the help of symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules. This enables them to obtain a significant amount of their required nutrients without the need for additional fertilizers.

However, providing some supplemental fertilizer can still be beneficial for the growth and productivity of earth peas. A balanced fertilizer with a ratio of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) such as a 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 can be used. This will provide additional nutrients that may be lacking in the soil.

It is recommended to apply the fertilizer at planting time or during early growth stages. Follow the instructions on the fertilizer packaging for the appropriate application rates, as excessive fertilizer can lead to imbalances and negatively affect plant health.
# Possible Disease of Earht Pea
## Virus
 Here are a few notable viral diseases that can affect Earth peas:

Infected plants may also exhibit stunted growth, reduced yield, and distorted pods. Preventing PSbMV starts with using certified disease-free seeds and practicing good sanitation to avoid the introduction and spread of the virus. Unfortunately, no treatment exists for PSbMV-infected plants, so prevention is key.

2. Pea Enation Mosaic Virus (PEMV): PEMV is another viral disease that affects Earth peas. It is transmitted by aphids and causes enation (wart-like growths) on the leaves, stunting of plants, and reduced yield. Controlling aphid populations through insecticidal sprays or introducing beneficial insects can help manage the spread of PEMV. Resistant cultivars are also available, so selecting those can be an effective prevention strategy.

3. Pea Leaf Roll Virus (PLRV): PLRV is transmitted by aphids and can infect Earth peas, leading to leaf rolling, yellowing, and stunted growth. Infected plants may also produce smaller, distorted pods. Controlling aphids through insecticidal sprays, implementing physical barriers, or introducing beneficial insects can help reduce the spread of PLRV. Again, using resistant cultivars can provide added protection against this virus.

## Fungus
 Here are a couple of notable fungal diseases that can affect Earth peas:

1. Powdery Mildew: Powdery mildew is a common fungal disease that can affect Earth peas. It manifests as a white, powdery growth on the leaves, stems, and pods of the plant.
