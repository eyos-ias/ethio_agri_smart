The toxicity of Earth Pea, also known as Lathyrus sativus, is related to a neurotoxin called beta-N-oxalyl-L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid (ODAP). Consuming large amounts of Earth Pea over an extended period can lead to a condition called Lathyrism, which can cause paralysis and other neurological symptoms. However, moderate consumption of Earth Pea is generally safe.
