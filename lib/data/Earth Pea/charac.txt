The Earth Pea, also known as Lathyrus sphaericus, is a plant species belonging to the Fabaceae family. Here are some details about its characteristics:

Plant Type: The Earth Pea is a perennial herbaceous plant. It is a climbing or sprawling vine with a twining habit, meaning it can climb or trail along other plants and support structures.

Mature Size: The mature size of the Earth Pea can vary, but on average, it reaches a height of about 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) and spreads to a similar width. However, the size can be influenced by growing conditions and available support structures.

Sun Exposure: The Earth Pea prefers full sun exposure, meaning it thrives in locations that receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. It can also tolerate partial shade, particularly in hotter regions.

Soil Type: This plant grows well in a variety of soil types, including loamy, sandy, and clay soils. It prefers well-draining soils that retain moisture without becoming waterlogged.

Soil pH: The Earth Pea generally prefers slightly acidic to neutral soil pH levels ranging from 6.0 to 7.0. However, it can tolerate a broader pH range, including slightly alkaline soils.

Bloom Time: The Earth Pea typically blooms in late spring to early summer, although the exact timing may vary depending on the specific climate and growing conditions. The flowering period can last several weeks.

Color: The flowers of the Earth Pea are usually in shades of pink, purple, or lavender. The petals exhibit a characteristic keel shape, which gives the flowers a unique appearance.

Hardiness Zones: The Earth Pea is native to various regions, including Europe and Asia. It is commonly found in hardiness zones 5 to 9, although specific varieties or subspecies may have slightly different ranges.

Native Area: The Earth Pea is native to multiple regions, including countries in Europe (such as Italy, France, and Greece) and Asia (including Turkey, Iran, and Kazakhstan).

Toxicity: It's important to note that some species within the Lathyrus genus, including the Earth Pea, contain certain compounds that can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. These compounds may affect the nervous system and cause a condition known as lathyrism. However, it is worth mentioning that toxic effects typically result from the consumption of significant quantities of the plant, especially the seeds. As a precaution, it's advisable to avoid using this plant for culinary purposes and to keep it out of the reach of children and pets.
