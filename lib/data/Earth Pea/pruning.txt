Pruning in Earth Pea is the process of cutting or removing certain parts of the plant to encourage better growth and productivity. This can involve trimming back excessive foliage, removing dead or damaged leaves, or cutting off certain branches to improve air circulation and sunlight exposure. Pruning helps the plant to focus its energy on producing healthy pods and prevents overcrowding or disease.
