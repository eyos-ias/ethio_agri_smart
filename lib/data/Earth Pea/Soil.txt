Well-draining soil: Soil that allows water to flow through easily and does not become waterlogged.
- Moisture retention: Soil that can retain some moisture to keep the plant adequately hydrated.
- Fertile soil: Soil that is rich in nutrients, which can be achieved by adding organic matter like compost or aged manure.
- Slightly acidic to neutral pH: Soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is generally preferred, but the Earth Pea can tolerate slightly alkaline soils as well.
