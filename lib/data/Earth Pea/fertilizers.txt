Earth peas are leguminous plants, which means they have the ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere with the help of symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules. This enables them to obtain a significant amount of their required nutrients without the need for additional fertilizers.

However, providing some supplemental fertilizer can still be beneficial for the growth and productivity of earth peas. A balanced fertilizer with a ratio of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) such as a 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 can be used. This will provide additional nutrients that may be lacking in the soil.

It is recommended to apply the fertilizer at planting time or during early growth stages. Follow the instructions on the fertilizer packaging for the appropriate application rates, as excessive fertilizer can lead to imbalances and negatively affect plant health.

Additionally, earth peas can benefit from organic matter incorporation into the soil. Adding compost or well-rotted manure before planting can improve soil fertility and provide a slow-release source of nutrients.

Regular soil testing is also recommended to determine if any specific nutrient deficiencies exist and adjust fertilizer applications accordingly.
