To grow Earth peas, also known as field peas or dry peas, follow these steps:

1. Choose the right time: Earth peas are cool-season crops that prefer temperatures between 55-75°F (13-24°C). Plant them in early spring or late summer/early fall, depending on your climate.

2. Prepare the soil: Select a well-draining location with full sun exposure. Loosen the soil using a garden fork or tiller, removing any weeds or rocks. Add organic matter like compost or aged manure to improve soil fertility.

3. Planting: Sow the seeds directly into the prepared soil, about 1-2 inches deep and 2-3 inches apart. Space rows about 18-24 inches apart to allow for proper growth. If planting in rows, consider using trellises or stakes for support.

4. Watering: Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water deeply once or twice a week, depending on rainfall and temperature. Avoid overhead watering to prevent disease.

5. Fertilizing: Earth peas are nitrogen-fixing plants, meaning they can convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form. They generally do not require additional nitrogen fertilization. However, you can apply a balanced organic fertilizer before planting if the soil lacks nutrients.

6. Weed control: Regularly remove weeds around the growing plants to reduce competition for nutrients and water. Mulching can help suppress weed growth.

7. Pests and diseases: Monitor for common pests like aphids, caterpillars, or pea weevils. Use organic pest control methods such as insecticidal soap or neem oil if necessary. Common diseases include powdery mildew and root rot, so ensure good air circulation and avoid overwatering.

8. Harvesting: Earth peas are typically harvested when the pods are fully mature and dry on the plant. The pods should be brown and crispy. Harvest by cutting the entire plant or by picking individual pods. Hang the plants upside down in a dry, well-ventilated area to allow the pods to fully dry.

9. Storing: Once the pods are dry, remove the peas from the pods and store them in airtight containers in a cool, dry place. They can be stored for several months.
