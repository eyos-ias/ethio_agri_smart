1. Wait about 90-100 days after planting Earth Peas to harvest them.
2. Look for green, plump, and firm pods that feel slightly crisp.
3. Hold the stem of the plant with one hand and gently twist the pod off with the other hand.
4. Only harvest what you need for immediate use, as they lose flavor and quality over time.
5. If you have extra, store them in a breathable container in the fridge for a few days.

Just be careful not to eat too many Earth Peas, as they can be toxic if consumed in large amounts over a long period.
