Water
The amount of water required may vary from 320 – 420 mm to 360 – 470 mm in warmer years to achieve maximum productivity. The frequency of barley watering also depends on the method of irrigation and the irrigation system capacity (mm/day), as it shows how much water the irrigation system can apply in one day.
