Fertilizers
Generally, barley plants, to grow best and give high yields, need mainly nitrogen (N), phosphate (P-P2O5), and potassium (K-K2O), but also sulfur (S) and copper (Cu) .
In the cultivation of malting barley, nitrogen fertilization should be applied from 7 to 14 days before sowing the grain. It takes about 19 kg of nitrogen for every 1 t of the expected grain yield, but taking into account soil nitrogen reserves, a dose of 50-70 kg N/ha is recommended.
