# What's Barley?
Barley (Hordeum vulgare), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 10,000 years ago. Globally 70% of barley production is used as animal fodder, while 30% as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation.
In 2017, barley was ranked fourth among grains in quantity produced (149 million tonnes or 330 billion pounds) behind maize (corn), rice and wheat.

# HOW to grow Barley?
To grow barley, follow these steps:

1. Choose a suitable location: Barley thrives in cool climates and requires full sun. 

2. Prepare the soil: Barley prefers slightly acidic to neutral soil. 

3. Planting: Sow the barley seeds directly into the prepared soil. The recommended depth is around 1-2 inches. Space the seeds about 1 inch apart in rows that are approximately 6-8 inches apart.

4. Watering: After planting, water the seeds thoroughly to ensure good germination. 

5. Fertilization: Barley generally does not require heavy fertilization. However, incorporating some compost or well-balanced fertilizer into the soil before planting can provide essential nutrients.

6. Maintenance: Regularly monitor the moisture levels of the soil and water as needed. Keep an eye out for any signs of pests or diseases and take appropriate measures if necessary.

7. Harvesting: Barley is typically ready for harvest when the grains have fully ripened and hardened. This usually occurs around 90-120 days after planting
# Light
Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is a long-day plant whose flowering is enhanced when the photoperiod is supplemented with far-red light, and this promotion is mediated by phytochrome.
# Soil
Sandy to moderately heavy loam soils of Indo-Gangetic plains having neutral to saline reaction and medium fertility are the most suitable type for barley cultivation. However, it may be grown on variety of soil 
# Water
The amount of water required may vary from 320 – 420 mm to 360 – 470 mm in warmer years to achieve maximum productivity. The frequency of barley watering also depends on the method of irrigation and the irrigation system capacity (mm/day), as it shows how much water the irrigation system can apply in one day.
# Temperature and Humidity
Barley may be grown in subtropical climatic condition. The crop requires around 12-15 0C during growing period and around 30 0C at maturity. It can not tolerate frost at any stage of growth and incidence of frost at flowering at highly detrimental for yield.
Barley is considered to be physiologically mature at approximately 35% moisture in the seeds and can be cut when the moisture content is 20-30% and allowed to dry in windrows or swaths. Barley harvested at 18% or higher moisture content can be easily damaged during threshing in the combine.
# Fertilizers
Generally, barley plants, to grow best and give high yields, need mainly nitrogen (N), phosphate (P-P2O5), and potassium (K-K2O), but also sulfur (S) and copper (Cu) .
In the cultivation of malting barley, nitrogen fertilization should be applied from 7 to 14 days before sowing the grain. It takes about 19 kg of nitrogen for every 1 t of the expected grain yield, but taking into account soil nitrogen reserves, a dose of 50-70 kg N/ha is recommended.
# Pests
The pests that threaten barley are mainly insects (1): Aphids (Bird cherry-oat aphid, Russian wheat aphid, Corn leaf aphid, etc.)

 # Herbs
 barley, the versatile and ancient cereal grain! While barley itself is not typically associated with a wide range of herbs, there are a few herbs that can complement its flavors and be used in culinary preparations with barley-based dishes. Here are a few examples:

Rosemary: Rosemary is a fragrant herb that can lend a savory and aromatic note to barley-based recipes. Its woody and slightly pine-like flavor pairs well with the earthiness of barley, whether used in soups, stews, or roasted barley dishes.

Thyme: Thyme is an herb with a pleasant earthy and slightly minty flavor that can enhance the taste of barley-based dishes. It can be used in soups, stews, casseroles, or even as a seasoning for roasted barley.

Parsley: Parsley is a versatile herb often used as a garnish but can also be incorporated into barley dishes to add a fresh and vibrant element. Its mild and slightly peppery flavor can complement the nuttiness of barley.

Dill: Dill, with its delicate and slightly sweet flavor, can add a refreshing touch to barley-based salads, pilafs, or grain bowls. Its aromatic and tangy notes can provide a pleasant contrast to the hearty texture of barley.
# Herbicides
Common herbicides used in barley cultivation include both pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicides. Pre-emergent herbicides are applied before weed seeds germinate, while post-emergent herbicides are applied after weeds have emerged from the soil.

Pre-emergent herbicides for barley may contain active ingredients such as pendimethalin, metolachlor, or flufenacet. These herbicides help prevent weed seeds from germinating and establishing in the barley field.

Post-emergent herbicides for barley can include products containing active ingredients like bromoxynil, dicamba, or MCPA. These herbicides target specific types of weeds that may have emerged alongside the barley plants.

It is essential to follow the instructions provided by the herbicide manufacturer and adhere to local regulations and guidelines. Always consult with local agricultural experts or extension services for specific herbicide recommendations tailored to your region and the challenges faced in barley cultivation.
# Toxicity:
 Barleys are generally non-toxic, but Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), and Lead (Pb) concentration in vegetative parts of barley had an increasing trend with increased metal application in irrigation water. These three metals have no nutritious capacity, but they are exceptionally toxic.
 # Harvesting
Barley Harvest is the cutting, threshing, separating, and cleaning of individual barley grains from the mature barley plant. Depending upon variety and climate conditions, barley grows from 12 to 48 inches tall.
# Pruning
Barley does not require pruning, but you can mow the crop to postpone flowering. Once you remove the seed head it will take time to produce another one, since it will eventually grow another.
# Crop Distance
The specific distance for barley plant spacing can vary depending on factors such as cultivar, soil conditions, climate, and the desired yield. Typically, barley is sown in rows, and the spacing between rows and individual plants within a row is crucial.

For barley, a common plant spacing is around 10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6 inches) between individual plants within a row. This spacing ensures that each barley plant has enough space to develop its root system and access nutrients and water in the soil.

Between rows, a spacing of approximately 15 to 20 centimeters (6 to 8 inches) is often recommended. This wider spacing allows for sufficient airflow, sunlight penetration, and ease of access for cultivation, harvesting, and pest control activities.

It's important to note that these spacing recommendations are general guidelines, and specific barley cultivars or regional practices may require adjustments. Additionally, local agricultural experts or extension services can provide tailored recommendations based on local conditions, barley cultivar, and specific farming goals.

Consulting with these experts or experienced barley growers in your area is highly recommended. They can provide you with personalized advice on the most suitable plant spacing for your specific region and barley cultivation practices.
