Temperature and Humidity
Barley may be grown in subtropical climatic condition. The crop requires around 12-15 0C during growing period and around 30 0C at maturity. It can not tolerate frost at any stage of growth and incidence of frost at flowering at highly detrimental for yield.
Barley is considered to be physiologically mature at approximately 35% moisture in the seeds and can be cut when the moisture content is 20-30% and allowed to dry in windrows or swaths. Barley harvested at 18% or higher moisture content can be easily damaged during threshing in the combine.
