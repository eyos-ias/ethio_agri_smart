# WHAT'S MANGO? 
Mango is a tropical fruit known for its sweet and juicy flavor. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is native to South Asia, although it is now cultivated in many parts of the world. Mangoes come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, ranging from green to yellow, orange, or red when ripe. The fruit has a smooth outer skin and a fibrous inner flesh surrounding a large, flat seed.

# How to grow Mango?
To grow a mango tree, here are some general steps to follow:

1. Climate and Location: Mango trees require a warm tropical or subtropical climate. Ensure that your location has a minimum temperature of 30°F (-1°C) and is frost-free.

2. Soil Preparation: Prepare the soil by ensuring it is well-draining and rich in organic matter. Amend the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve its fertility and drainage.

3. Planting: Plant a grafted mango tree rather than growing from seed, as it ensures a true-to-type variety. Dig a hole that is wide and deep enough to accommodate the root ball of the tree. 

4. Watering: Water the newly planted tree thoroughly and regularly, especially during the establishment period. 

5. Fertilization: Mango trees benefit from regular fertilization. Apply a balanced fertilizer specifically formulated for fruit trees according to the manufacturer's instructions.

6. Pruning: Prune the mango tree to maintain its size and shape, promote airflow, and remove dead or diseased branches

7. Pest and Disease Control: Monitor the tree for common pests like aphids, scales, and fruit flies. Use appropriate organic or chemical controls if necessary.

8. Harvesting: Mangoes typically take several months to ripen after flowering. Harvest the fruit when it reaches its mature size, color, and aroma. 


# Light
Mango trees require full sun exposure to thrive and produce abundant fruit. They need a minimum of 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Lack of sufficient sunlight can result in poor growth, reduced fruit production, and increased susceptibility to diseases. Therefore, it is important to plant mango trees in a location where they can receive ample sunlight throughout the day.
# Soil

Mango trees prefer well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. They can grow in sandy, loamy, or clay soils, but good drainage is important to prevent root rot. Adding organic matter like compost or manure can improve soil fertility.

# Water
Mango trees require regular watering, especially during the growing season. Here's a shorter summary of their water requirements:

Mango trees need consistent watering, especially during the growing season. Keep the soil evenly moist, but avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Water deeply and infrequently, allowing the top few inches of soil to dry out between waterings. Adjust watering frequency based on weather conditions and the tree's water needs.

# Temperature and Humidity
Mango trees thrive in warm and humid conditions. Here's a shorter summary of their temperature and humidity requirements:

Mango trees prefer temperatures between 70°F and 85°F (21°C to 29°C). They can tolerate brief periods of temperatures as low as 40°F (4°C) but are sensitive to frost. High humidity levels, ideally between 50% and 70%, are beneficial for mango trees. However, they can still grow in lower humidity environments with proper care and irrigation.

# Ferilizers
Mango trees benefit from regular fertilization to support healthy growth and fruit production. Here's a shorter summary of their fertilizer requirements:

Use a balanced fertilizer with a ratio of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), such as a 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 formula. Apply the fertilizer three times a year: in early spring, early summer, and early fall. Use a slow-release fertilizer or organic compost to provide a steady supply of nutrients over time. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates based on the tree's size and age. Additionally, consider supplementing with micronutrients like iron, zinc, and magnesium if deficiencies are observed. Regularly monitor the tree's health and adjust the fertilizer program as needed.
# Pests
Mango trees can be susceptible to various pests. Here are some common pests that can affect mango trees:
1. Mango Fruit Fly: 
2. Mango Seed Weevil: 
3. Mango Shoot Borer:
4. Mango Leafhopper:
5. Mango Aphids: 
6. Mango Scale Insects: 
7. Mango Mealybugs: 
# Pesticides
Here are some commonly used pesticides for controlling pests in mango trees:
1. Neem Oil
2. Pyrethroids
3. Organophosphates
4. Carbaryl shoot borers.
5. Spinosad
When using pesticides, it's important to carefully follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
