3. Planting: Plant a grafted mango tree rather than growing from seed, as it ensures a true-to-type variety. Dig a hole that is wide and deep enough to accommodate the root ball of the tree. 

4. Watering: Water the newly planted tree thoroughly and regularly, especially during the establishment period. 

5. Fertilization: Mango trees benefit from regular fertilization. Apply a balanced fertilizer specifically formulated for fruit trees according to the manufacturer's instructions.

6. Pruning: Prune the mango tree to maintain its size and shape, promote airflow, and remove dead or diseased branches

7. Pest and Disease Control: Monitor the tree for common pests like aphids, scales, and fruit flies. Use appropriate organic or chemical controls if necessary.

8. Harvesting: Mangoes typically take several months to ripen after flowering. Harvest the fruit when it reaches its mature size, color, and aroma. 


# Light
Mango trees require full sun exposure to thrive and produce abundant fruit. They need a minimum of 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Lack of sufficient sunlight can result in poor growth, reduced fruit production, and increased susceptibility to diseases. Therefore, it is important to plant mango trees in a location where they can receive ample sunlight throughout the day.
# Soil

Mango trees prefer well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. They can grow in sandy, loamy, or clay soils, but good drainage is important to prevent root rot. Adding organic matter like compost or manure can improve soil fertility.

# Water
Mango trees require regular watering, especially during the growing season. Here's a shorter summary of their water requirements:

Mango trees need consistent watering, especially during the growing season. Keep the soil evenly moist, but avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Water deeply and infrequently, allowing the top few inches of soil to dry out between waterings. Adjust watering frequency based on weather conditions and the tree's water needs.

# Temperature and Humidity
Mango trees thrive in warm and humid conditions. Here's a shorter summary of their temperature and humidity requirements:

Mango trees prefer temperatures between 70°F and 85°F (21°C to 29°C). They can tolerate brief periods of temperatures as low as 40°F (4°C) but are sensitive to frost. High humidity levels, ideally between 50% and 70%, are beneficial for mango trees. However, they can still grow in lower humidity environments with proper care and irrigation.

# Ferilizers
Mango trees benefit from regular fertilization to support healthy growth and fruit production. Here's a shorter summary of their fertilizer requirements:

Use a balanced fertilizer with a ratio of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), such as a 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 formula. Apply the fertilizer three times a year: in early spring, early summer, and early fall. Use a slow-release fertilizer or organic compost to provide a steady supply of nutrients over time. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates based on the tree's size and age. Additionally, consider supplementing with micronutrients like iron, zinc, and magnesium if deficiencies are observed. Regularly monitor the tree's health and adjust the fertilizer program as needed.
# Possible Dosease of Mango
## Virus
 While millet is not as commonly affected by viral diseases as some other crops, there are still a few viruses that can pose a threat. Let us explore some possible viral diseases that millet may encounter:

1. Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus (MDMV): Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus is a common viral disease that affects various grass crops, including millet. It is transmitted by aphids and causes stunted growth, yellowing or mottling of leaves, and reduced grain quality and yield. Infected plants may exhibit mosaic patterns or streaks on the leaves.

2. Sugarcane Mosaic Virus (SCMV): Sugarcane Mosaic Virus is another viral disease that can infect millet. It is transmitted by aphids and causes chlorotic streaks or mosaic patterns on the leaves. Infected plants may also exhibit stunted growth and reduced grain production.

## Fungus
 While millet is generally considered a resilient crop, it is not impervious to the impact of fungal infections. Let us explore some possible fungal diseases that millet may encounter:

1. Head Smut (Sphacelotheca spp.): Head smut is a common fungal disease that affects millet. It causes the formation of black, powdery masses of spores on the inflorescences (panicles) of the plant. These spores can spread to healthy plants, leading to reduced grain quality and yield.

2. Ergot (Claviceps spp.): Ergot is a fungal disease caused by species of the Claviceps genus. It produces black, elongated structures called sclerotia on the millet panicles. These sclerotia can replace the seeds, reducing yield and quality. Ergot-infected grains may also contain toxic alkaloids, posing a risk to humans and livestock if consumed.

3. Downy Mildew (Sclerospora spp.): Downy mildew is a fungal disease that affects various crops, including millet. It manifests as yellow to orange lesions on the leaves, leading to wilting and drying out. Infected panicles may also show discoloration and reduced seed set.

4. Rust (Puccinia spp.): Rust is a fungal disease that causes orange to reddish-brown pustules on the leaves, stems, and panicles of millet. Severe infections can result in premature leaf senescence, stunted growth, and reduced grain production.
## Bacteria
 While millet is generally considered resilient to bacterial infections, it is not invulnerable to their impact. Let us explore some possible bacterial diseases that millet may encounter:

1. Bacterial Leaf Streak (Xanthomonas spp.): Bacterial leaf streak is a common bacterial disease that affects various grass crops, including millet. It is caused by Xanthomonas bacteria. Symptoms include elongated, water-soaked lesions on the leaves, which later turn brown or black. In severe cases, these lesions can coalesce and cause leaf blight, leading to reduced photosynthesis and yield.

2. Bacterial Panicle Blight (Burkholderia glumae): Bacterial panicle blight is caused by the bacterium Burkholderia glumae. It primarily affects the panicles of millet, leading to blighted florets and discolored seed heads. Infected panicles may have a dark, slimy appearance, and the seeds may become shriveled and discolored.

Preventing and managing bacterial diseases in millet requires a proactive approach. Here are some additional steps to consider:

1. Seed Treatment: Use certified disease-free seeds from reputable suppliers to reduce the risk of introducing bacterial pathogens. Seed treatments with hot water or disinfectants can help eliminate bacterial contaminants.

2. Crop Rotation: Practice crop rotation to disrupt disease cycles and reduce the buildup of bacterial pathogens in the soil. Avoid consecutive plantings of millet or other susceptible crops in the same field.

3. Field Sanitation: Maintain good field hygiene by removing and destroying crop debris after harvest. This helps reduce the presence of bacterial pathogens and their potential to overwinter and infect future crops.

4. Irrigation Management: Avoid over-irrigation or excessive moisture, as it can create favorable conditions for bacterial diseases. Proper irrigation management and adequate soil drainage are crucial to minimize disease risks.

5. Resistant Varieties: Consider planting millet varieties that exhibit resistance or tolerance to specific bacterial diseases prevalent in your region. Consult with local agricultural experts or seed suppliers for recommended varieties.

# Pre-preevntion of Disease of Mango
