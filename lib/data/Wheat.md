# What's Wheat?
Wheat is a cereal grain that is widely cultivated and consumed around the world. It belongs to the Triticum genus and is a member of the grass family, Poaceae. Wheat is one of the most important staple crops and a significant source of calories and nutrients for a large portion of the global population.

# How to grow Wheat?
Growing wheat involves several steps and considerations. Here is a general guide on how to grow wheat:

Select the Right Variety: Choose a wheat variety that is well-suited to your region's climate, soil conditions, and intended use (e.g., bread-making, feed, or durum wheat for pasta).

Prepare the Soil: Prepare the soil by removing weeds, rocks, and debris. Wheat grows best in well-drained loamy soils.

Planting Time: Determine the appropriate planting time based on your location and the specific variety of wheat.

Seedbed Preparation: Create a seedbed by tilling the soil to a depth of around 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm). 

Seed Selection and Planting: Choose high-quality wheat seeds that are free from disease and have good germination rates. Plant the seeds using a seed drill or a broadcast spreader, ensuring even distribution. 

Fertilization: Apply fertilizers based on soil test results and specific nutrient requirements for wheat. 

Irrigation: Monitor soil moisture and provide irrigation as needed. Adequate moisture is crucial for wheat development, especially during key stages such as germination, tillering, and grain filling

Weed and Pest Management: Control weeds through mechanical methods, such as cultivation or hand-weeding, and/or the use of herbicides. 

Harvesting: Harvesting time varies depending on the wheat variety, location, and intended use. 
# Light
Wheat requires full sun exposure to grow and develop properly. Full sun refers to at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Sunlight is essential for wheat because it drives the process of photosynthesis, where plants convert light energy into sugars to fuel their growth and development.
# Water
Water is crucial for the growth and development of wheat. Adequate and timely water supply is necessary for optimal wheat production. The water requirements of wheat vary depending on factors such as climate, soil type, stage of growth, and specific environmental condition
