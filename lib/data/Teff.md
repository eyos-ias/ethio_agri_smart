If you have any concerns about the safety or potential allergic reactions to teff, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or an allergist.

# Harvesting
 Here are the general steps involved in the harvesting process of teff:

1. Monitoring maturity: Farmers closely monitor the teff crop to determine the optimal time for harvest. The crop is usually ready for harvest when the majority of the grains have turned from green to a golden or light brown color.

2. Cutting: Teff is often harvested by cutting the plants close to the ground using sickles or scythes. This is typically done manually, especially in traditional or small-scale farming systems.

3. Bundling: After cutting, the teff plants are gathered into small bundles or sheaves and tied together. 

4. Drying: The bundled teff plants are then left in the field to dry. They are typically arranged in upright position or stacked in small shocks to allow air circulation and promote drying. 

5. Threshing: Once the teff plants have sufficiently dried, the next step is threshing. Threshing involves separating the grain from the rest of the plant material. 

6. Winnowing: After threshing, the mixture of teff grains and chaff is subjected to winnowing. Winnowing is the process of separating the lighter chaff and other plant debris from the heavier teff grains. 

7. Cleaning and storage: The final step involves cleaning the teff grains to remove any remaining impurities or foreign matter. This can be done by sieving or using other cleaning equipment.
# Pruning
Here are a few examples:

1. Thinning: In the early stages of teff growth, when the plants are densely populated, thinning can be performed to remove excess plants. Thinning allows for proper spacing between plants, reducing competition for resources and promoting healthier growth.

2. Topping: Topping involves removing the top portion of the teff plants, usually before flowering or seed setting. Topping can be done to control plant height, promote tillering (side shoot development), and improve overall grain quality.

3. Weed control: While not technically pruning, effective weed control practices can be considered as a way to manage the growth and development of teff. By removing competing weeds from the teff field, the crop can access more resources and grow more vigorously.


##  What  time is best  for pruning
 The timing for these practices can vary depending on factors such as the specific teff variety, local growing conditions, and the desired outcome. Here are some general guidelines:

1. Thinning: Thinning is usually performed when the teff plants are still in the early growth stages and are densely populated. It is typically done shortly after germination when the seedlings have developed a few leaves.

2. Topping: Topping, which involves removing the top portion of the teff plants, is generally done before flowering or seed setting. This practice is often carried out to control plant height, promote tillering (side shoot development), and improve grain quality.
# Crop Distance
The spacing or distance between teff plants can have an impact on the yield and productivity of the crop. The optimal plant spacing for teff depends on various factors, including the specific teff variety, soil fertility, water availability, and local growing conditions. However, a general recommended plant spacing for teff is around 10-15 centimeters (4-6 inches) between plants within a row.

The exact spacing may vary depending on the farming system and the intended use of the teff crop. In traditional or small-scale farming, teff is often sown by broadcasting the seeds across the field, resulting in a dense stand of plants. In such cases, thinning may be necessary to achieve the desired plant density and spacing.
