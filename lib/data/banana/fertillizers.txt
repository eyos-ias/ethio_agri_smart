Fertilizers
The  banana requires regular fertilizer application because it is a heavy feeder. Most farmers use an 8-10-8 NPK (Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium) fertilizer. You can spread the fertilizer around the base of the trunk evenly once a month, avoiding getting in contact with it.
The best fertilizer for banana trees is one that is high in potassium, as bananas require a lot of potassium to grow and produce fruit. Other important nutrients for banana trees include nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium. A balanced fertilizer with a ratio of 5-10-10 or 8-12-12 is a good choice.
