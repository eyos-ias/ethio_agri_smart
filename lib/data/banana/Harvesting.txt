Harvesting
Bananas are harvested raw and ripened artificially. The dwarf bananas are ready for harvest within 11- 14 months after planting, while tall cultivars take about 14-16 months to harvest. A bunch usually takes 90-120 days to mature after shooting, depending on climate and cultural practices.
