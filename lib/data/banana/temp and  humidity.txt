Temperature and Humidity
In order to attain the best quality ripe fruit bananas (20 cm) should be stored at 18oC and relative humidity during ripening must be 80 - 85%.
According to the US Department of Agriculture, the desired storage temperature for bananas is 56 to 58 degrees Fahrenheit. That means that bananas are best stored at room temperatureâ€”so your countertop really is the right place for them.
A humidity of at least 50%, preferably higher, is recommended since the banana plant is native to hot and humid parts of the world. Dry air will damage the banana leaves
