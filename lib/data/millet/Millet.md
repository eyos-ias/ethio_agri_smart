# What is millet?
Millets are a group of cereal grains that belong to the Poaceae family, commonly known as the grass family (1). It's widely consumed in developing countries throughout Africa and Asia. While it may look like a seed, millet's nutritional profile is similar to that of sorghum and other cereals.

# How to grow Millets?
To grow millet, follow these steps:

1. Choose the right variety: There are different types of millet, such as pearl millet, foxtail millet, and finger millet
2. Prepare the soil: Millet prefers well-drained soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5. Remove any weeds and rocks from the area and loosen the soil to a depth of about 6 inches.
3. Sow the seeds: Millet can be directly sown into the ground or started indoors and transplanted later. If sowing directly, plant the seeds about 1 inch deep and 3 inches apart.
4. Watering: Millet requires regular watering until it establishes itself. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Once established, millet is drought-tolerant and requires less water.
5. Fertilization: Millet is a low-maintenance crop that doesn't require heavy fertilization. However, adding compost or well-rotted manure before planting can provide some nutrients.
6. Weed control: Keep the area around the millet plants free from weeds, as they can compete for nutrients and water.
7. Harvesting: The time to harvest millet depends on the variety and purpose. For grain production, wait until the seed heads turn golden brown and the seeds are hard
8. Storage: Store millet grains in a cool, dry place in airtight containers to prevent moisture and pest damage.
# Light

All cultivars of Pearl Millet thrive on full sun though they will tolerate partial shade. The richest color purple and maroon leaves are achieved in full sun, and planting these cultivars in any other light conditions will not do them justice.
# Soil
Millet has wide adaptability to different soil from very poor to very fertile and can tolerate a certain degree of alkalinity. The best soils are alluvial, loamy and sandy soil with good drainage.
# Water
1 cup dry, raw millet yields about 3 ½ cups cooked millet. How much liquid do I need to cook millet? To cook 1 cup of millet in a pilaf-style (as described below), you'll need 2 cups of water. If you want to make a creamier porridge, increase the water to 3 cups.
# Temperature and Humidity
Finger millet grows best in an environment with medium rainfall, an annual temperature range of 11 to 27°C and a soil pH of 5.0 to 8.2 (Duke 1978, 1979). Areas with low precipitation and low relative humidity during seed ripening and maturation are best for regeneration.
# Fertilizers
For sorghum and millet, the main types of fertilizer which should be applied before planting are phosphorus (P) fertilizers as well as organic matter.
Nitrogen fertilizer is often required for profitable production. Proso millet planted following another crop, such as wheat, has a higher nitrogen requirement than after summer fallow.
# Pests
Shoot fly, stemborer, earworm and millet midge are the most important pests in millet, but also grasshoppers, locusts, white grubs and various butterfl ies can attack the crop. Birds are also important millet grain pests. The sorghum shoot fly (Atherigona soccata) is also known to attack millets.
# Pesticides
Contact herbicides (e.g., sulfuric acid, diquat, paraquat) kill only the plant organs with which they are in contact. Translocated herbicides (e.g., amitrole, picloram, and 2,4-D) are effective against roots or other organs to which they are transported from aboveground treated surfaces (i.e., soil).
# Herbs
When it comes to common herbs associated with millet, the list may be more limited compared to other culinary grains. However, there are still a few herbs that can complement the flavors of millet-based dishes. Here are a couple of examples:

Cilantro (Coriander): Cilantro is a versatile herb with a fresh and citrusy flavor that can pair well with the nutty taste of millet. It can be used as a garnish for millet salads, mixed into grain bowls, or incorporated into millet-based stuffing or pilaf recipes.

Thyme: Thyme is an herb with a slightly earthy and minty flavor that can provide a subtle herbal note to millet dishes. It can be added to savory millet recipes such as pilafs, stews, or as a seasoning for roasted millet-based dishes.
# Herbicides
when it comes to herbicides for millet (Pennisetum glaucum) or any agricultural crop, it is crucial to approach herbicide use with caution and in accordance with local regulations and best agricultural practices. While herbicides can be effective in managing weeds, it is important to prioritize sustainable and responsible practices to protect the health of the crop, the environment, and those who consume the harvested millet.

The selection and use of herbicides can vary depending on factors such as weed species, regional regulations, and specific challenges faced by millet growers. Local agricultural experts, extension services, or agricultural authorities are the best sources of information regarding approved herbicides and recommended practices in your region.
# Toxicity
The millet is reported to be toxic to animals when consumed (Bazlur, 1960). The symptoms of Kodo poisoning in the affected people are characterized by nausea, vomiting, delirium, depression, intoxication, and unconsciousness. Kodo millet is often found heavily infested with Aspergillus tamarii Kita.
# How to harvest Millets?
When the millet is mature and dry enough for harvesting, the grains pop out cleanly when the head is pinched. At this point, harvesting can commence. Millet is harvested manually using a knife or sickle. The panicles are harvested into baskets or bags and stored on a wooden rack to dry before they are threshed.
# Pruning
Pruning millet refers to the removal of excess or unwanted plant parts to promote better growth, health, and yield. While millet is not typically pruned extensively like fruit trees or shrubs, there are a few instances where pruning may be beneficial:

Most of the millets need warm soil temperatures of typically 70 degrees F. or more for seed germination, so are normally planted in the latter half of May or early June depending on the growing region; proso millet can tolerate cooler temperatures and can be seeded when soil temperature is 55 to 65 degrees F.
# Crop Distances
The specific distance required between millet plants can vary depending on factors such as the millet variety, soil fertility, regional climate conditions, and farming practices. However, a general guideline is to space millet plants approximately 10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6 inches) apart within rows.

For row spacing, it is common to leave approximately 30 to 45 centimeters (12 to 18 inches) between rows. This spacing provides enough room for the millet plants to spread their foliage and develop their root systems, ensuring efficient management operations, adequate airflow, and ease of access for maintenance and harvesting.
