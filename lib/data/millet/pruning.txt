pruning
Pruning millet refers to the removal of excess or unwanted plant parts to promote better growth, health, and yield. While millet is not typically pruned extensively like fruit trees or shrubs, there are a few instances where pruning may be beneficial:

Most of the millets need warm soil temperatures of typically 70 degrees F. or more for seed germination, so are normally planted in the latter half of May or early June depending on the growing region; proso millet can tolerate cooler temperatures and can be seeded when soil temperature is 55 to 65 degrees F.
