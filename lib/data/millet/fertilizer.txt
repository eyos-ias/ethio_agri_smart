fertilizers
For sorghum and millet, the main types of fertilizer which should be applied before planting are phosphorus (P) fertilizers as well as organic matter.
Nitrogen fertilizer is often required for profitable production. Proso millet planted following another crop, such as wheat, has a higher nitrogen requirement than after summer fallow.
