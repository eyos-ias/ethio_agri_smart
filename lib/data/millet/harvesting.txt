harvesting
When the millet is mature and dry enough for harvesting, the grains pop out cleanly when the head is pinched. At this point, harvesting can commence.Â Millet is harvested manually using a knife or sickle. The panicles are harvested into baskets or bags and stored on a wooden rack to dry before they are threshed.
