HOW TO GROW?
To grow millet, follow these steps:

1. Choose the right variety: There are different types of millet, such as pearl millet, foxtail millet, and finger millet
2. Prepare the soil: Millet prefers well-drained soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5. Remove any weeds and rocks from the area and loosen the soil to a depth of about 6 inches.
3. Sow the seeds: Millet can be directly sown into the ground or started indoors and transplanted later. If sowing directly, plant the seeds about 1 inch deep and 3 inches apart.
4. Watering: Millet requires regular watering until it establishes itself. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Once established, millet is drought-tolerant and requires less water.
5. Fertilization: Millet is a low-maintenance crop that doesn't require heavy fertilization. However, adding compost or well-rotted manure before planting can provide some nutrients.
6. Weed control: Keep the area around the millet plants free from weeds, as they can compete for nutrients and water.
7. Harvesting: The time to harvest millet depends on the variety and purpose. For grain production, wait until the seed heads turn golden brown and the seeds are hard
8. Storage: Store millet grains in a cool, dry place in airtight containers to prevent moisture and pest damage.
