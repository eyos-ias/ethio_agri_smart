pest and pesticides
Shoot fly, stemborer, earworm and millet midge are the most important pests in millet, but also grasshoppers, locusts, white grubs and various butterfl ies can attack the crop. Birds are also important millet grain pests. The sorghum shoot fly (Atherigona soccata) is also known to attack millets.
Contact herbicides (e.g., sulfuric acid, diquat, paraquat) kill only the plant organs with which they are in contact. Translocated herbicides (e.g., amitrole, picloram, and 2,4-D) are effective against roots or other organs to which they are transported from aboveground treated surfaces (i.e., soil).
