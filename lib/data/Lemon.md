# How to grow Lemons?
Growing lemons requires specific conditions and care. Here are some steps to help you grow your own lemon tree:

1. Choose the right variety: Select a lemon variety suitable for your climate and intended use. Common varieties include Eureka, Lisbon, and Meyer.
2. Find a suitable location: Lemon trees need a sunny spot with well-drained soil. They prefer a location protected from strong winds and frost.
3. Prepare the soil: Prior to planting, prepare the soil by removing weeds, rocks, and debris. Lemons prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5.
4. Planting: Plant lemon trees in spring or early summer when the soil is warm. Dig a hole slightly larger than the root ball of the tree. Place the tree in the hole, ensuring it is planted at the same depth as it was in the nursery container.
5. Watering: Lemon trees require regular watering, especially during dry periods or when they are establishing. Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth. 
6. Fertilization: Apply a balanced citrus fertilizer according to the package instructions. Feed your lemon tree in early spring before new growth begins and again in late spring or early summer. 
7. Pruning: Prune your lemon tree to maintain its shape, remove dead or diseased wood, and improve air circulation. Prune in late winter or early spring before new growth starts. 
8. Pest and disease control: Monitor your lemon tree regularly for pests like aphids, scale insects, or citrus leaf miners. Use organic or chemical controls as necessary to prevent damage. 
9. Harvesting: Lemons are typically ready for harvest when they have reached their desired size and color. They can be left on the tree for several months, allowing them to develop more flavor.
# Light
Lemon plants need the equivalent of 7+ hours of direct sunlight [DLI of 21+ mol/m²/day] to grow their best. In order to provide an equivalent amount with a grow light, it needs to be pretty bright!
# Soil

The Lemon tree can adapt to almost any type of soil excluding those of heavy clay. The ideal soil for this tree is a rich and well-drained sandy loam. Drained loam or Sandy Loam is the soil typically used for gardening because it produces more nutrients and moisture that can help the tree to grow vigorously.
# Water 
Lemon trees typically need an inch or two of water applied once or twice weekly. Container-grown lemon trees typically require watering more frequently. They may need to be watered every day or two if grown outdoors during hot weather. Lemon tree watering is different for older trees in the ground.
# Temperature and Humidity
Temperature and humidity 
Lemon trees thrive at steady temperatures between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
Relative Humidity – Lemons do best with a relative humidity of about 90% to 95%. If the relative humidity is too low lemons may suffer moisture loss which will result in shriveling and drying out. If the relative humidity is too high lemons may be more vulnerable to problems such as mold.
# Fertilizer
Fertilizers 
The ideal NPK ratio for lemon tree fertilizer is 6-6-6. This means it contains equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This balanced mix of nutrients will ensure your lemon trees have access to all the macronutrients they need to grow strong and healthy and to produce a crop of delicious, juicy fruit.
# Pests
What is a common pest?
When you think of house pests, insects may be the first critters that come to mind. After all, who likes seeing ants or flies infesting their home? Other common house insects include feared pests such as termites, bed bugs and cockroaches.
# Pesticides
What pesticides are used on lemons?

Conventional lemons are treated with imazalil, a fungicide, after harvest to prevent mold and stem rot, in addition to a coating of wax — often petroleum or shellac-based. If that wasn't enough of a bummer, imazalil has been labeled “likely to be carcinogenic” by the Environmental Protection Agency.
# Herbs
When it comes to herbs that pair well with lemon, there are a few common ones that can enhance its citrusy notes and create delightful culinary combinations. Here are a few examples:

Mint: Mint is a herb known for its cool and refreshing flavor, which complements the tanginess of lemon wonderfully. The combination of lemon and mint can be used in beverages like lemonade or infused water, as well as in salads, marinades, and desserts.

Basil: Basil, with its aromatic and slightly sweet flavor, can add a pleasant herbal note to lemon-based dishes. The pairing of lemon and basil works well in salads, pasta dishes, dressings, and even in lemon-infused desserts like lemon basil sorbet.

Thyme: Thyme is an herb with a subtle earthy and lemony flavor, making it an excellent companion for lemon. It can be used in savory dishes such as roasted vegetables, poultry, fish, or even infused into lemon-infused oils and vinegars.

Rosemary: Rosemary is an herb with a distinct pine-like aroma and a slightly citrus undertone. When combined with lemon, it can add depth and complexity to dishes like roasted chicken, grilled fish, or lemon-infused oils and sauces.
# Herbicides
When it comes to herbicides specifically for lemon trees (Citrus limon) or citrus orchards, the selection and use of herbicides can vary depending on factors such as weed species, regional regulations, and specific challenges faced by citrus growers. Local agricultural experts or extension services are the best sources of information regarding approved herbicides and recommended practices in your region.

Common herbicides used in citrus orchards can include both pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicides. Pre-emergent herbicides are applied before weed seeds germinate, while post-emergent herbicides are applied after weeds have emerged.

It is essential to follow the instructions provided by the herbicide manufacturer and adhere to local regulations and guidelines. Always consult with local agricultural experts or extension services for specific herbicide recommendations tailored to your region and the challenges faced in lemon cultivation.
# Toxicity
Lemons are generally considered safe and non-toxic for human consumption. However, consuming excessive amounts of lemon juice or its peel can cause certain side effects due to its high acidity. These side effects may include tooth erosion, stomach discomfort, heartburn, and irritation of the mouth or throat. It is always recommended to consume lemons in moderation as part of a balanced diet.
# How to harvest Lemons?
Lemons are normally hand-picked using the twist, tilt and snap method. Fruit are generally not picked using clippers. Fruit should not be ''plugged'' (the button pulled out) and the entire fruit stem should be removed. Fruit should not be harvested in cold (<13oC) or hot (>35oC) conditions.
# Pruning
Prune lemon trees in early spring, before they flower and new growth starts to appear. Cut off no more than ⅓ of the branches in a single year. Trim any vertical-growing sprouts from the base or trunks of the tree and remove dead, diseased, or crossed-over branches.
What is the best time for pruning?
winter
Generally, the best time to prune or trim trees and shrubs is during the winter months. From November through March, most trees are dormant which makes it the ideal time for the following reasons: Trees are less susceptible to insects or disease.
# Crop Distances
When it comes to the spacing or distance required for lemon trees, it is essential to provide adequate room for their growth and optimal development.

The specific spacing requirements for lemon trees can vary depending on factors such as the variety of lemon, the rootstock used, climate, soil conditions, and the desired size of the tree. Generally, lemon trees need sufficient space to spread their branches, access sunlight, and ensure proper air circulation.

For standard-sized lemon trees, a spacing of about 4 to 6 meters (13 to 20 feet) between individual trees is often recommended. This spacing allows enough room for the lemon trees to grow, ensuring they don't compete for resources such as water and nutrients. It also allows for ease of maintenance, harvesting, and pest management activities.

If you are planning to grow dwarf or semi-dwarf lemon tree varieties, which are smaller in size, the spacing can be reduced accordingly. A spacing of around 2 to 3 meters (6 to 10 feet) between individual dwarf or semi-dwarf lemon trees is often suitable.

Keep in mind that these spacing recommendations are general guidelines, and specific lemon varieties or regional practices may require adjustments. Additionally, local agricultural experts, nurseries, or extension services can provide you with personalized advice on the most suitable spacing for your specific region and lemon cultivation practices.
