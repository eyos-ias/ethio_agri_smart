# What is an orange ?
Orange is the colour between yellow and red on the spectrum of visible light. Human eyes perceive orange when observing light with a dominant wavelength between roughly 585 and 620 nanometres. In traditional colour theory, it is a secondary colour of pigments, produced by mixing yellow and red.

# How to grow Orange?
Growing oranges requires a suitable climate, proper soil conditions, and regular care. Here are the general steps to grow oranges:

1. Climate: Oranges thrive in warm and subtropical climates. They require a minimum temperature of 55°F (13°C) during the growing season and a frost-free period of at least 9 months.

Growing oranges requires a suitable climate, proper soil conditions, and regular care. Here are the general steps to grow oranges:

1. Climate: Oranges thrive in warm and subtropical climates. They require a minimum temperature of 55°F (13°C) during the growing season and a frost-free period of at least 9 months.
2. Soil: Oranges prefer well-draining soil with a pH level between 6 and 7.5. The soil should be rich in organic matter and have good water-holding capacity.
3. Variety selection: Choose the right variety of orange tree based on your climate, available space, and desired fruit characteristics. Common orange varieties include Valencia, Navel, and Blood oranges.

4. Planting: Select a sunny location with at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Dig a hole twice as wide and deep as the root ball of the young orange tree. Place the tree in the hole, ensuring that the graft union (the swollen area where the tree was grafted onto the rootstock) is above the soil level. Backfill the hole with soil, gently firming it around the roots.

5. Watering: Water the newly planted orange tree thoroughly, and then maintain regular watering to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Deep watering once or twice a week is usually sufficient, depending on rainfall and temperature.

6. Fertilization: Orange trees benefit from regular fertilization. Apply a balanced citrus fertilizer according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically in spring and late summer. Avoid over-fertilization, as it can lead to excessive vegetative growth and reduced fruit quality.

7. Pruning: Prune orange trees to remove dead or diseased branches, improve air circulation, and maintain a desirable shape. Pruning is typically done in late winter or early spring before new growth begins.
8. Pest and disease control: Monitor your orange tree regularly for pests like aphids, scale insects, and citrus leaf miners. Use appropriate insecticides or organic pest control methods to manage infestations

9. Harvesting: Oranges are usually ready for harvest when they reach their full color and flavor.

# Light 


Oranges require 8-12 hours of sunlight daily to prosper, 5-6 hours to just survive. Grown indoors, a South or west facing window is best.

# Soil

Deep well drained loamy soils are the best for the cultivation of sweet orange. Heavy soils, if well drained, yield good crops but cultivation becomes difficult. The pH of soil should be 6.5 to 7.5 and EC of water should be less than 1.0. Plant is highly sensitive to water-logged soils


# Water
Depending on the age of the tree, oranges should be watered 1–3 times per week. However, oranges need several gallons of water per week. You do not need to water your orange tree every day. Orange trees need several gallons of water, split into 1–3 weekly sessions.
# Temperatureand Humidity
Temperature – Oranges should be stored at about 38°F to 48°F. Warmer temperatures will result in more rapid loss of quality while prolonged exposure to temperatures below 38°F may result in freeze damage.
Aim for a temperature range of 35 to 50°F (1 to 10°C) to slow down the ripening process without freezing those juicy gems. As for humidity, oranges like it around 85 to 90%. If it's too dry, they might dry out and lose their juiciness, but if it's too humid, they could become moldy.


#  Fertilizers 
-8-8 or 10-10-10, slow-release, liquid fertilizer will provide the plant with all the essential nutrients and micronutrients. The best time to fertilize Orange trees is during spring and summer. Fertilizing Oranges will also increase their size and weight during the fruit growing stage.
# Pests
Pests 
during flowering and seed development, watch for seed and head clipping weevils, maggots, sunflower midges, sunflower moths, and lygus bugs. Of course, aphids can be a problem at any time. Keep reading to learn more about each of these pests and how to control them.
# Herbicideses
Several herbicide options are available including S-metolachlor, acetochlor, pendimethalin and linuron, but on their own rarely provided sufficient control of a broad spectrum of weeds.
# Herbs
While onions themselves are not typically associated with a wide range of herbs, there are a few common herbs that pair well with their savory and aromatic flavors. Here are a couple of examples:

Parsley: Parsley is a classic herb that can complement the flavors of onions beautifully. Its fresh and slightly peppery taste can add a bright and herbaceous note to dishes containing onions. Whether used as a garnish or incorporated into sauces, soups, or salads, parsley can enhance the overall flavor profile of onion-based recipes.

Thyme: Thyme is an herb with a robust and earthy flavor that can enhance the savory qualities of onions. Its aromatic notes can add depth and complexity to onion-based dishes such as roasted onions, soups, stews, or even sautéed onions for various culinary preparations.
# Herbicides
when it comes to herbicides for onions (Allium cepa) or any agricultural crop, it is important to approach herbicide use with caution and in accordance with local regulations and best agricultural practices. While herbicides can be effective in managing weeds, it is crucial to prioritize sustainable and responsible practices to protect the health of the onion plants, the environment, and those who consume these flavorful bulbs.

The selection and use of herbicides can vary depending on factors such as weed species, regional regulations, and specific challenges faced by onion growers. Local agricultural experts, extension services, or agricultural authorities are the best sources of information regarding approved herbicides and recommended practices in your region.
# Toxicity
Safflower oil is composed mainly of oleic and linoleic acids. These two unsaturated fats make up 90% of safflower oil. The saturated fatty acids palmitic acid and stearic acid make up the remaining 10% ( 6 ).

# Pruning
Pruning orange trees is an essential practice in citrus orchards to maintain tree health, promote optimal fruit production, and shape the tree's growth. Pruning involves selectively removing certain parts of the tree, such as branches, shoots, or suckers. Here are some key aspects of pruning orange trees:
## what time is best for pruning

The best time for pruning orange trees is typically during the late winter or early spring, just before new growth begins. This period is often referred to as the tree's dormant season. Pruning at this time offers several advantages:
