# How to grow Mandarin?
To grow mandarin oranges, follow these steps:

1. Climate and soil requirements: Mandarin oranges thrive in warm climates with full sun exposure.
2. Choosing the right variety: Select a mandarin orange variety suitable for your climate and available space.
3. Planting: Plant mandarin orange trees in the spring or fall, when the temperatures are moderate. Dig a hole that is wider and deeper than the root ball of the tree. Place the tree in the hole, ensuring that the bud union (swollen area where the tree was grafted) is above ground level. 
4. Watering: Provide regular watering to young trees, ensuring that the soil remains moist but not waterlogged. Established trees generally require 1-2 inches of water per week, especially during hot and dry periods.
5. Fertilization: Apply a balanced citrus fertilizer according to the package instructions. Generally, it is recommended to fertilize mandarin oranges three times a year: in early spring, late spring, and late summer.
6. Pruning: Prune mandarin orange trees to remove dead or diseased branches, improve air circulation, and maintain a desired shape. Pruning is typically done in late winter or early spring before new growth appears.
7. Pest and disease control: Keep an eye out for common citrus pests such as aphids, scale insects, and citrus leaf miners. Regularly inspect your trees for signs of disease, such as citrus canker or citrus greening, and take appropriate action if necessary.
8. Harvesting: Mandarin oranges are typically ready for harvest in late fall or winter, depending on the variety and climate. They should be easily detached from the tree when ripe and have a deep orange color.
# Light
Mandarins prefer 8-12 hours of sunlight a day. If you have a limited light area, use full spectrum grow lights. Temperatures: These plants grow best when the temperature averages 65 degrees; the preferred range is 55 degrees to 85 degrees.
# Soil
Make sure the soil is acidic, loose, sandy, and well-drained. Mandarin orange needs well-drained soil. Too much moisture and the wrong soil type can make the tree susceptible to disease. Fertilize the Mandarin orange every 1-2 months for best results.
# Water
Here are some key points regarding watering mandarin trees:

1. Adequate Moisture: Mandarins prefer well-drained soil that retains moisture but does not become waterlogged. The soil should be evenly moist, but not consistently saturated.

2. Frequent Watering: Newly planted mandarin trees require more frequent watering until they establish a strong root system. Water young trees deeply and often enough to keep the root zone consistently moist.

3. Deep Watering: When irrigating mature mandarin trees, it's important to provide deep watering that reaches the entire root zone. This encourages the roots to grow deeper, making the tree more drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.

4. Rainfall Considerations: Take into account natural rainfall patterns when determining the frequency of watering. Adjust the irrigation schedule accordingly, reducing watering during periods of adequate rainfall and increasing it during drier spells.

5. Mulching: Applying a layer of organic mulch around the base of the mandarin tree helps retain soil moisture, prevent weed growth, and regulate soil temperature. Mulch also reduces water evaporation from the soil surface.

6. Water Conservation: To conserve water and promote efficient irrigation, consider using drip irrigation or soaker hoses.
# Temperature and Humidity
temperature and humidity
Mandarin oranges are delicate fruits that require proper storage to maintain their freshness and flavor. When it comes to storing them at room temperature, finding the ideal temperature is crucial. Aim for a cool room with temperatures between 55°F and 68°F (13°C and 20°C).
Humidity 
86%, a relative humidity of 85 – 90% is required. Only lemons, oranges and mandarins with a dark green peel color are able to withstand a relative humidity of 82 – 85%. Oranges require particular temperature, humidity/moisture and ventilation conditions (SC VII) (storage climate conditions).
# Fertilizer

 Here are some key points regarding fertilizer for mandarin trees:

1. Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium (NPK): Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio that is suitable for citrus trees, such as a 2:1:1 or 3:1:1 ratio. Nitrogen (N) promotes leafy growth, phosphorus (P) supports root development and flowering, and potassium (K) aids in fruit development and overall tree vigor.

2. Slow-Release Fertilizer: Consider using a slow-release fertilizer specifically formulated for citrus trees. These fertilizers release nutrients gradually over an extended period, providing a steady supply of nutrients to the tree.

3. Seasonal Application: Fertilize mandarin trees during the active growing season, typically in the spring and summer. Avoid fertilizing during the dormant period, as excessive nutrients can lead to imbalances and potential damage to the tree.

4. Application Rate: Follow the instructions on the fertilizer package for the recommended application rate based on the size and age of your mandarin tree. 

5. Organic Amendments: Consider incorporating organic materials, such as compost or well-rotted manure, into the soil around the tree. These amendments improve soil structure, enhance nutrient availability, and promote beneficial microbial activity.

6. Micronutrients: In addition to the primary nutrients (NPK), mandarin trees may benefit from micronutrients such as iron, zinc, manganese, and copper.
