# How to grow Mandarin?
To grow mandarin oranges, follow these steps:

1. Climate and soil requirements: Mandarin oranges thrive in warm climates with full sun exposure.
2. Choosing the right variety: Select a mandarin orange variety suitable for your climate and available space.
3. Planting: Plant mandarin orange trees in the spring or fall, when the temperatures are moderate. Dig a hole that is wider and deeper than the root ball of the tree. Place the tree in the hole, ensuring that the bud union (swollen area where the tree was grafted) is above ground level. 
4. Watering: Provide regular watering to young trees, ensuring that the soil remains moist but not waterlogged. Established trees generally require 1-2 inches of water per week, especially during hot and dry periods.
5. Fertilization: Apply a balanced citrus fertilizer according to the package instructions. Generally, it is recommended to fertilize mandarin oranges three times a year: in early spring, late spring, and late summer.
6. Pruning: Prune mandarin orange trees to remove dead or diseased branches, improve air circulation, and maintain a desired shape. Pruning is typically done in late winter or early spring before new growth appears.
7. Pest and disease control: Keep an eye out for common citrus pests such as aphids, scale insects, and citrus leaf miners. Regularly inspect your trees for signs of disease, such as citrus canker or citrus greening, and take appropriate action if necessary.
8. Harvesting: Mandarin oranges are typically ready for harvest in late fall or winter, depending on the variety and climate. They should be easily detached from the tree when ripe and have a deep orange color.
# Light
Mandarins prefer 8-12 hours of sunlight a day. If you have a limited light area, use full spectrum grow lights. Temperatures: These plants grow best when the temperature averages 65 degrees; the preferred range is 55 degrees to 85 degrees.
# Soil
Make sure the soil is acidic, loose, sandy, and well-drained. Mandarin orange needs well-drained soil. Too much moisture and the wrong soil type can make the tree susceptible to disease. Fertilize the Mandarin orange every 1-2 months for best results.
# Water
Mandarin orange needs 0.8 cups of water every 9 days when it doesn't get direct sunlight and is potted in a 5.0" pot.
# Temperature and Humidity
temperature and humidity
Mandarin oranges are delicate fruits that require proper storage to maintain their freshness and flavor. When it comes to storing them at room temperature, finding the ideal temperature is crucial. Aim for a cool room with temperatures between 55°F and 68°F (13°C and 20°C).
Humidity 
86%, a relative humidity of 85 – 90% is required. Only lemons, oranges and mandarins with a dark green peel color are able to withstand a relative humidity of 82 – 85%. Oranges require particular temperature, humidity/moisture and ventilation conditions (SC VII) (storage climate conditions).
# Fertilizer

Mandarin orange needs well-drained soil. Too much moisture and the wrong soil type can make the tree susceptible to disease. Fertilize the Mandarin orange every 1-2 months for best results. Use a fertilizer high in phosphorous during the growing season(10-30-20).
# Pests
Orange trees can be heavily affected by insects (mainly aphids) and also by fungal, bacterial and virus diseases. Aphids (mainly Aphis spiraecola) are small flies that are fed with the underside of leaves, often resulting in the curl of citrus leaves.
# Pesticides
The two most frequently found pesticides were phosphonic acid and spirotetramat, with an incidence rate of 48.7% and 46.5%, respectively. The concentration of phosphonic acid and spirotetramat in mandarin samples varied from 0.026 to 39.386 mg kg−1 and from 0.010 to 1.485 mg kg−1, respectively.
# Herbs
the delightful mandarin, with its sweet and juicy flesh! While mandarins themselves are not typically associated with a wide range of herbs, there are a few common herbs that can complement their flavor and be used in culinary preparations alongside mandarin-based dishes. Here are a few examples:

Mint: Mint is a versatile herb that pairs well with the sweet and citrusy flavors of mandarins. Its refreshing taste can be a great addition to mandarin salads, fruit salads, or infused water with mandarin slices.

Basil: Basil, with its aromatic and slightly sweet flavor, can provide a lovely herbal note to mandarin-based dishes. It can be used in salads, dressings, or even as a garnish for mandarin-infused desserts.

Rosemary: Rosemary is an herb with a distinct pine-like aroma that can add depth and complexity to the sweetness of mandarins. It can be used sparingly in mandarin marinades, savory sauces, or even in mandarin-infused oils.

Thyme: Thyme is an herb with a subtle earthy flavor that can complement the bright flavors of mandarins. It can be used in savory dishes like roasted vegetables with mandarin zest, or in mandarin-infused syrups for desserts.
# Herbicides

when it comes to herbicides for mandarin trees (Citrus reticulata) or citrus orchards in general, it is important to approach herbicide use with caution and in accordance with local regulations and best agricultural practices. While herbicides can be effective in managing weeds in agricultural settings, it is crucial to prioritize sustainable and responsible practices, especially when it comes to the cultivation of beloved fruits like mandarins.

The selection and use of herbicides can vary depending on factors such as weed species, regional regulations, and specific challenges faced by citrus growers. Local agricultural experts or extension services are the best sources of information regarding approved herbicides and recommended practices in your region.
# Toxicity
Mandarin oranges, like other citrus fruits, are generally considered safe and non-toxic for consumption. They are a common fruit enjoyed by people all over the world and are not known to have any significant toxicity issues. However, it is important to note that some individuals may have allergies or sensitivities to citrus fruits, so it is always advisable to consume them in moderation and consult a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or specific health conditions. Additionally, the seeds of mandarin oranges should not be consumed as they can pose a choking hazard.
# How to harvest Mandarin?
Mandarin and mandarin types also vary based on variety, but the harvest time for most ranges from November to December. The Owari satsuma types are the earliest and harvest is usually completed by November. Unlike other mandarins, satsuma fruit holds poorly on the tree after ripening and should be picked promptly.
# Pruning
By pruning your mandarin tree, you're keeping it more manageable in size with bigger and higher quality fruit. Skirting (removing low-hanging branches) allows light to penetrate the canopy and letting air circulate under the tree. With that, you prevent fruit damage and also increase the size and quality of the fruit.
what time is best for Pruning
Generally, the best time to prune or trim trees and shrubs is during the winter months. From November through March, most trees are dormant which makes it the ideal time for the following reasons: Trees are less susceptible to insects or disease.
# Crop Distance
When it comes to the spacing or distance required for mandarin trees, it is essential to provide adequate room for their growth, access to sunlight, and proper air circulation.

The specific spacing requirements for mandarin trees can vary depending on factors such as the variety of mandarin, rootstock used, climate, soil conditions, and the desired size of the tree. Generally, mandarin trees need sufficient space to spread their branches and allow for optimal fruit development.

For standard-sized mandarin trees, a spacing of about 4 to 6 meters (13 to 20 feet) between individual trees is often recommended. This spacing allows enough room for the mandarin trees to grow and ensures they don't compete for resources such as water and nutrients. It also allows for ease of maintenance, harvesting, and pest management activities.
