The overall optimum temperature grapevine growth is 77 and 90 degrees F (25 to 32°C). Any temperature below this optimum range causes vegetative growth to become limited. Temperatures above the optimum range reduce the grapevines photosynthesis rate due to the increase in respiration.
The ideal condition for grapes is 30 – 32 F with 90 – 95 percent relative humidity. Grapes generally have a much longer shelf life than other berries but they still need care to keep them at their best. Do not store grapes near a cooling unit's direct air path to avoid accelerated dehydration.
