Pruning 
Pruning: Removal of portions of a grapevine for the purpose of maintaining size, shape and productivity. Renewal Spur: A cane pruned to one node with the primary purpose of producing a vegetative shoot (cane) for next year's fruiting wood.

What is the best for Pruning?

Grapes are best pruned in spring (February/March, or even as late as early April) because if pruned too early a hard frost in late winter can damage the canes and buds.
