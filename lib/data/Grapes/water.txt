Water

While climate and humidity play important roles as well as the soil, a typical grape vine needs 25 to 35 inches (635 to 890 mm) of water a year, occurring during the spring and summer months of the growing season, to avoid stress.
During the dormant season, grapevines are in a state of rest, and excessive rain can affect the grapevines differently than if they were actively growing. The waterlogged soil can suffocate the roots, leading to root damage, rot, and the inability to absorb necessary nutrients.
