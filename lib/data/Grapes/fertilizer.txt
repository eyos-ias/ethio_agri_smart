Apply 5-10 pounds (2-4.5 kg.) of poultry or rabbit manure, or 5-20 (2-9 kg.) pounds of steer or cow manure per vine. Other nitrogen-rich grapevine fertilizers (such as urea, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate) should be applied after the vine has blossomed or when grapes are about ¼ inch (0.5 cm.)
We recommend using Stark® Tre-Pep® fertilizer for your grapes, applied 2-3 inches deep and 10-12 inches away from the plant. A second and third application may be made at the same rate after six and twelve weeks of growth. Always apply fertilizer according to the package directions.
