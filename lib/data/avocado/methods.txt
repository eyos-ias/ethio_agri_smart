HOW to grow?
Growing avocado trees from seed can be a fun and rewarding project. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to grow avocado:

1. Obtain an avocado seed: After enjoying an avocado, carefully remove the seed from the center. 

2. Prepare the seed: Insert three to four toothpicks into the seed's sides, about halfway up. 

3. Suspend the seed in water: Place the seed with the toothpicks in a glass or jar filled with water. 

4. Find a warm and bright spot: Place the glass or jar in a warm location with indirect sunlight, such as a windowsill. 

5. Change the water regularly: Every few days, change the water in the glass or jar to prevent mold growth. 

6. Wait for germination: It may take anywhere from two to eight weeks for the seed to sprout. 

7. Transplant the sprouted seed: Once the sprout is around 6-7 inches tall and has developed roots, carefully transplant it into a pot filled with well-draining soil. 

8. Provide proper care: Place the potted avocado plant in a sunny location where it receives at least six hours of sunlight daily.
Fertilize with a balanced houseplant fertilizer every few months.

9. Monitor growth and repot if needed: As your avocado plant grows, you may need to repot it into a larger container to accommodate its roots. 

10. Be patient and enjoy the process: Growing an avocado tree from seed can take several years before it bears fruit.
