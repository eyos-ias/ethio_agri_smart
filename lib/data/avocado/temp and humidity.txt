Temperature and Humidity
Avocado trees do best at moderately warm temperatures (60 F to 85 F) with moderate humidity.
The ideal relative humidity range for the majority of avocado varieties is between 45 to 65%, give or take 5%. Just as in extremely hot conditions, very dry air also causes avocado leaf stomata to reduce function for optimal tree health and fruit set.
Remember that avocado trees do best at moderately warm temperatures (60 F to 85 F) with moderate humidity. They can tolerate temperatures, once established, of around 28 F to 32 F with minimal damage.
