The Lemon tree can adapt to almost any type of soil excluding those of heavy clay. The ideal soil for this tree is a rich and well-drained sandy loam. Drained loam or Sandy Loam is the soil typically used for gardening because it produces more nutrients and moisture that can help the tree to grow vigorously.
