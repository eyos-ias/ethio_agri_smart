What pesticides are used on lemons?

Conventional lemons are treated with imazalil, a fungicide, after harvest to prevent mold and stem rot, in addition to a coating of wax — often petroleum or shellac-based. If that wasn't enough of a bummer, imazalil has been labeled “likely to be carcinogenic” by the Environmental Protection Agency.
