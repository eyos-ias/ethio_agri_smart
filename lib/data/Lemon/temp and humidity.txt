Temperature and humidity 

Lemon trees thrive at steady temperatures between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
Relative Humidity â€“ Lemons do best with a relative humidity of about 90% to 95%. If the relative humidity is too low lemons may suffer moisture loss which will result in shriveling and drying out. If the relative humidity is too high lemons may be more vulnerable to problems such as mold.
