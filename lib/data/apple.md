# What's an Apple?
An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree Malus domestica. Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.

# How grow an Apple? 
1.  Choosing the Right Variety: Start by selecting an apple variety suitable for your climate zone. Consider factors such as taste, texture, and whether you prefer dessert apples or cooking apples. 
 2.  Planting Location: Apple trees need a sunny location with well-drained soil. The soil should have a slightly acidic to neutral pH. Test the soil and make amendments if necessary before planting.
 3.  Planting Process: Dig a hole that is wide and deep enough to accommodate the tree's roots. Place the tree in the hole and spread out the roots carefully. Backfill the hole with soil, firming it gently around the roots. Ensure that the graft union (the swollen area where the cultivar is grafted onto the rootstock) is above the soil level. 
  4.  Watering and Mulching: Water the newly planted tree thoroughly and regularly during the first growing season. Mulching around the base of the tree with organic material like wood chips or straw helps retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. 
  5.  Pruning and Training: Pruning is important for managing the shape, size, and productivity of the tree. Prune during the dormant season, removing dead, damaged, or crossing branches. 
   6.  Fertilizing: Apple trees benefit from regular fertilization. Apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring and late fall, following the instructions on the product packaging. 
   7.  Pest and Disease Management: Monitor your apple tree for common pests like aphids, codling moths, or apple maggots, and implement appropriate control measures if necessary. Organic approaches like maintaining good tree hygiene, promoting biodiversity, and using biological controls are often preferred. 
 8.  Harvesting: Apples typically ripen in late summer or fall, depending on the variety. Harvest the fruit when it reaches its proper maturity stage by gently twisting it or lifting and testing for easy separation.
# Light
Apple trees need full sun to grow properly and produce fruit. This level of exposure means the tree will see at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight each day. Anything less than this will result in poor fruit yields or a lack of fruit entirely.
# Soil
 Apples grow best on a well-drained, loam soils having a depth of 45 cm and a pH range of pH 5.5-6.5. The soil should be free from hard substrata and water-logged conditions. Soils with heavy clay or compact subsoil are to be avoided.
 # Water
  Apple tree water requirements depend on rainfall. In general, for an established tree, you won't need to water it unless you are not getting much rain or there is a particularly dry spell or even drought. About an inch (2.5 cm.) or so of rainfall every week to ten days is adequate for most apple trees.
  # Temperature and Humidity
  Apples are best stored at 30°- 32°F, with a relative humidity of 90 percent and some air circulation. These conditions provide the greatest delay in the normal ripen- ing and aging process of the fruit.
 # Fertilizers
 Experts recommend fertilizing your apple tree right after you plant it, and then a second time in early summer. During the second year, experts suggest fertilizing once in early spring, and a second time in early summer. Fertilize mature apple trees once a year during the spring. Apple trees mainly prefer high nitrogen fertilizer. Composted chicken manure, blood, soybean, cottonseed, and feather are excellent organic nitrogen sources. Organic fertilizers provide the Apple trees with the nutrients they need to grow healthy Apples and grow stronger.
 # Possible Disease of Apple
 ## Virus
 There are several viral diseases that can affect apple trees. Here are a few examples:

Apple mosaic virus (ApMV): This virus causes a mosaic pattern of light and dark green on the leaves of infected trees. It can also cause distorted growth and reduced fruit quality.

Apple stem pitting virus (ASPV): ASPV causes pits and grooves on the surface of the apple tree's stem. Infected trees may also exhibit stunted growth, reduced fruit size, and premature fruit drop.

Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV): ACLSV causes yellow or chlorotic spots on the leaves of infected apple trees. It can also lead to reduced fruit quality and yield.

Apple necrotic mosaic virus (ANMV): ANMV causes chlorotic mottling, necrotic spots, and ring patterns on the leaves. Infected trees may also exhibit reduced growth and yield.

Apple stem grooving virus (ASGV): ASGV causes grooves and depressions on the stem of infected apple trees. It can also lead to reduced fruit size and quality.
## Fungus
There are several fungal diseases that can affect apple trees. Here are some common examples:

Apple scab (Venturia inaequalis): This is one of the most common and destructive fungal diseases of apple trees. It causes dark, scaly lesions on leaves, fruit, and twigs, leading to defoliation and reduced fruit quality.

Powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha): Powdery mildew appears as a white, powdery coating on the leaves, shoots, and fruit. It can cause leaf curling, stunted growth, and reduced yield.

Apple rust (Gymnosporangium spp.): Apple rust is a fungal disease that affects both apple trees and junipers. It causes bright orange, rusty-colored spots on leaves, twigs, and fruit. Severe infections can lead to defoliation and fruit drop.

Apple canker (Neonectria ditissima): Apple canker is a fungal disease that causes sunken, corky lesions on the bark of branches and trunks. It can weaken trees, leading to dieback and reduced vigor.

Sooty blotch and flyspeck (Various fungi): These fungal diseases cause dark, superficial blemishes on the surface of apple fruit. While they don't usually affect the flesh of the fruit, they can reduce its marketability.
## Bacteria
There are a few bacterial diseases that can affect apple trees. Here are some examples:

Fire blight (Erwinia amylovora): Fire blight is a highly destructive bacterial disease that affects various parts of apple trees, including blossoms, shoots, branches, and fruit. It causes wilting, blackening, and "burned" appearance of infected tissues, giving it the name "fire blight." The disease can spread rapidly and severely damage or kill entire trees.

Crown gall (Agrobacterium tumefaciens): Crown gall is caused by a soil-borne bacterium that enters the tree through wounds or injuries in the roots or trunk. It leads to the formation of abnormal growths or galls on the roots and lower trunk of apple trees. Severe infections can disrupt water and nutrient uptake, reducing tree vigor and productivity.

Bacterial canker (Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae): Bacterial canker affects the branches, twigs, and trunk of apple trees. It causes sunken, dark lesions that may ooze bacterial exudates. The disease can lead to dieback of affected branches and, in severe cases, can result in tree decline or death.
# Pre-Preventaion of Disease of Apple
Prevention is crucial when it comes to managing diseases in apple trees. Taking proactive measures can help reduce the risk of disease outbreaks. Here are some pre-prevention strategies for apple tree disease management:

Site selection: Choose a well-drained location with good air circulation for planting apple trees. Avoid areas prone to frost pockets or where water tends to accumulate, as these conditions can favor the development of certain diseases.

Plant disease-resistant varieties: Select apple tree varieties that have natural resistance or tolerance to common diseases prevalent in your area. Consult with local agricultural extension services or nurseries to identify disease-resistant varieties suitable for your region.

Proper spacing: Plant apple trees with adequate spacing to allow for good air movement between the trees. Proper spacing helps reduce humidity levels and minimizes the spread of diseases.

Soil management: Ensure proper soil health and fertility by testing the soil and following the recommended amendments. Maintain optimal soil pH and improve soil drainage if necessary. Healthy soil promotes healthy tree growth and improves disease resistance.

Clean planting material: Start with healthy nursery stock or certified disease-free planting material. Purchase apple tree saplings from reputable nurseries that have stringent disease management practices in place.

Quarantine measures: If you introduce new apple trees or planting material into your orchard, isolate them from existing trees for a quarantine period. This allows you to monitor the health of the new trees and prevent the potential introduction of diseases.

Sanitation practices: Practice good orchard sanitation by removing fallen leaves, pruned branches, and other plant debris regularly. Clearing the orchard floor reduces the availability of disease inoculum and helps minimize disease pressure.

Water management: Avoid over-irrigation, as excess moisture can create favorable conditions for certain diseases. Provide consistent and appropriate watering to maintain optimal soil moisture levels without causing waterlogged conditions.

Integrated pest management (IPM): Implement an IPM program to manage insect pests and minimize their impact on tree health. Some insect pests can transmit diseases, so controlling their populations can indirectly help prevent disease outbreaks.

Education and monitoring: Stay informed about common diseases affecting apple trees in your region. Regularly monitor your orchard for signs of diseases, such as leaf spots, cankers, or abnormal growth. Early detection allows for timely intervention and prevents the spread of diseases.

# Post-Prevention of Disease of Apple
After taking preventive measures, it's important to continue with post-prevention strategies to monitor and manage any potential diseases that may still occur. Here are some post-prevention practices for managing diseases in apple trees:

Regular monitoring: Conduct routine inspections of your apple trees to identify any signs or symptoms of diseases. Early detection allows for timely intervention and effective disease management.

Proper identification: If you notice any abnormalities or suspect a disease, accurately identify the specific pathogen or disease causing the symptoms. This can be done through visual examination or by consulting with a plant pathologist or agricultural expert.

Integrated pest management (IPM): Implement an IPM approach, which involves a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical control strategies to manage diseases effectively. This may include practices such as targeted pesticide applications, biological controls, and habitat manipulation.

Disease-resistant varieties: Consider planting disease-resistant apple varieties. These varieties have been bred or selected for their resistance to specific diseases, reducing the likelihood of infection and minimizing the need for intensive disease management.

Fungicide applications: If necessary, apply fungicides according to recommended guidelines and timing. Fungicides can help to control fungal diseases and prevent their spread. Follow the instructions on the product label and consider the potential impacts on beneficial organisms and the environment.

Pruning and sanitation: Prune out infected branches or cankers promptly and dispose of the pruned material properly. This helps prevent the disease from spreading to healthy parts of the tree or neighboring trees. Maintain good sanitation practices in the orchard to minimize disease inoculum.

Nutritional management: Provide proper nutrition to your apple trees to promote overall tree health and resilience. Balanced fertilization, including appropriate levels of essential nutrients, can help trees withstand disease pressures.

Record keeping: Maintain records of disease occurrences, treatments applied, and their effectiveness. This information can help you assess the success of your disease management efforts and make informed decisions in the future.


# Pests

5. Nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus): Nasturtiums not only add vibrant colors to the garden but also act as trap plants for aphids. They can attract aphids away from apple trees, serving as sacrificial plants.

6. Comfrey (Symphytum spp.): Comfrey is a nutrient-rich plant that can be used as a mulch or compost material around apple trees. As it breaks down, it releases nutrients into the soil, benefiting the tree's overall health.

 # Herbicides
 Some common herbicides used in apple orchards include:

1. Glyphosate: This broad-spectrum herbicide is commonly used to control a wide range of weeds in apple orchards.

2. 2,4-D: This selective herbicide is effective against broadleaf weeds and is often used in combination with other herbicides for weed control in apple orchards.

3. Dicamba: Another selective herbicide, dicamba is used to control broadleaf weeds in apple orchards.

4. Atrazine: This herbicide is primarily used to control grassy weeds in apple orchards.

5. Simazine: Similar to atrazine, simazine is also used for controlling grassy weeds in apple orchards.

It is important to note that the use of herbicides should be done following proper guidelines and regulations to ensure the safety of the environment and human health.
# Toxicity
Apple flesh and peel are very healthful and pose no risks. Yet chewed or crushed apple seeds release small amounts of cyanide, which is highly toxic.
# Harvesting
The fruits mature within 130-150 days after the full bloom stage depending upon the variety grown. The ripening of fruits is associated with the change in colour, texture, quality and the development of the characteristic flavour. The fruits at the time of harvest should be uniform, firm and crisp.
# Pruning
Pruning What is pruning in Apple?\n We prune apple trees for four main reasons. First, to make the tree easy to maintain and harvest by controlling the height and shape. Secondly, to maintain a healthy tree by removing dead, diseased or damaged wood. Thirdly, to improve air circulation which reduces pests and diseases.\n What is the best time to prune apple trees? Spring\n PROCESS \n Prune out strong shoots growing towards the centre. You can leave weaker shoots (up to 20cm/8in long) unpruned. Look for any downward-growing branches low on the tree that receive little light and could cause an obstruction. Prune to a more upward-growing branch or back to the main trunk.
## What time is best for pruning of apple
The best time for pruning apple trees is during late winter or early spring, before new growth begins. This is typically done when the tree is still dormant, before the buds start to swell. Pruning during this time helps stimulate new growth and allows for better shaping and training of the tree. It is important to avoid pruning apple trees during the fall or summer, as this can leave the tree vulnerable to disease and pests.
# Crop Distance
The required distance for apple trees can vary depending on the specific variety and rootstock being used, as well as the desired growth habit (e.g., dwarf, semi-dwarf, standard). However, a general guideline for spacing apple trees is typically around 12 to 15 feet (3.6 to 4.5 meters) between trees within a row and 18 to 20 feet (5.4 to 6 meters) between rows. This spacing allows for proper air circulation, sunlight exposure, and room for the trees to grow and develop their root systems without overcrowding. It is always recommended to consult with local agricultural extension services or experts for specific recommendations based on your location and apple tree variety.
