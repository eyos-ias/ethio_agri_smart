pests
Orange trees can be heavily affected by insects (mainly aphids) and also by fungal, bacterial and virus diseases. Aphids (mainly Aphis spiraecola) are small flies that are fed with the underside of leaves, often resulting in the curl of citrus leaves.
The two most frequently found pesticides were phosphonic acid and spirotetramat, with an incidence rate of 48.7% and 46.5%, respectively. The concentration of phosphonic acid and spirotetramat in mandarin samples varied from 0.026 to 39.386 mg kg−1 and from 0.010 to 1.485 mg kg−1, respectively.
