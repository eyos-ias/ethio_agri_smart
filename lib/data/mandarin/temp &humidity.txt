temperature and humidity
Mandarin oranges are delicate fruits that require proper storage to maintain their freshness and flavor. When it comes to storing them at room temperature, finding the ideal temperature is crucial. Aim for a cool room with temperatures between 55°F and 68°F (13°C and 20°C).
Humidity 
86%, a relative humidity of 85 – 90% is required. Only lemons, oranges and mandarins with a dark green peel color are able to withstand a relative humidity of 82 – 85%. Oranges require particular temperature, humidity/moisture and ventilation conditions (SC VII) (storage climate conditions).
