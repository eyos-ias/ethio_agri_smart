Harvesting
Mandarin and mandarin types also vary based on variety, but the harvest time for most ranges from November to December. The Owari satsuma types are the earliest and harvest is usually completed by November. Unlike other mandarins, satsuma fruit holds poorly on the tree after ripening and should be picked promptly.
