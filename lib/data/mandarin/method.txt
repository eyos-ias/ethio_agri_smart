To grow mandarin oranges, follow these steps:

1. Climate and soil requirements: Mandarin oranges thrive in warm climates with full sun exposure.
2. Choosing the right variety: Select a mandarin orange variety suitable for your climate and available space.
3. Planting: Plant mandarin orange trees in the spring or fall, when the temperatures are moderate. Dig a hole that is wider and deeper than the root ball of the tree. Place the tree in the hole, ensuring that the bud union (swollen area where the tree was grafted) is above ground level. 
4. Watering: Provide regular watering to young trees, ensuring that the soil remains moist but not waterlogged. Established trees generally require 1-2 inches of water per week, especially during hot and dry periods.
5. Fertilization: Apply a balanced citrus fertilizer according to the package instructions. Generally, it is recommended to fertilize mandarin oranges three times a year: in early spring, late spring, and late summer.
6. Pruning: Prune mandarin orange trees to remove dead or diseased branches, improve air circulation, and maintain a desired shape. Pruning is typically done in late winter or early spring before new growth appears.
7. Pest and disease control: Keep an eye out for common citrus pests such as aphids, scale insects, and citrus leaf miners. Regularly inspect your trees for signs of disease, such as citrus canker or citrus greening, and take appropriate action if necessary.
8. Harvesting: Mandarin oranges are typically ready for harvest in late fall or winter, depending on the variety and climate. They should be easily detached from the tree when ripe and have a deep orange color.
