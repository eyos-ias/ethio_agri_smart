Temperature and Humidity
Cabbage prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55-75째F (13-24째C), optimum being 60-70째F (16-21째C), but will produce good crops under warmer, summer conditions. FALL CROP: Use midseason and storage varieties. Start seedlings as above in May and transplant to the garden in June-July.
Humidity. A cabbage is approximately 92% water. From the time of harvest it is important to cool the cabbage as quickly as possible and maintain a relative humidity of at least 90% or higher. Relative humidities below 80% will result in moisture loss and unacceptable shrinkage of the heads.
