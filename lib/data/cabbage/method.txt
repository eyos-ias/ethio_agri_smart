HOW to grow?
To grow cabbage, follow these steps:
1. Choose a suitable location: Cabbage prefers full sun, so select a spot in your garden that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. 

2. Prepare the soil: Remove any weeds or debris from the planting area. Loosen the soil to a depth of 12-15 inches using a garden fork or tiller. 

3. Start seeds indoors (optional): If you want an early start, you can start cabbage seeds indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date. Use seed trays or small pots filled with seed-starting mix. 

4. Direct sowing: Alternatively, you can directly sow cabbage seeds in the garden once the soil temperature reaches around 45°F (7°C). 

5. Watering: Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Cabbage requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. 

6. Fertilization: Apply a balanced fertilizer or compost around the base of the cabbage plants about three weeks after transplanting or when seedlings are well-established.

7. Pest control: Monitor your cabbage plants regularly for any signs of pests such as aphids, caterpillars, or slugs.

8. Weed control: Keep the area around your cabbage plants weed-free to prevent competition for nutrients and water.

9. Harvesting: Cabbage is typically ready for harvest around 80-100 days after planting, depending on the variety. Harvest the heads when they reach a firm, solid consistency and have reached the desired size.
