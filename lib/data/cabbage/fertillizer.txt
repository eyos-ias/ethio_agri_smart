Fertilizers
A diluted solution of a balanced (10-10-10) liquid fertilizer, weak compost tea, or fish emulsion is recommended. This can be repeated every two weeks. Once cabbage plants have been transplanted into a prepared garden bed, continue applying cabbage fertilizer every three to four weeks until heads begin to form.
To produce optimum yields of good quality cabbages, often high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer are applied.
