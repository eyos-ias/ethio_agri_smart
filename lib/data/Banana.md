# What's Banana?
A banana is an elongated, edible fruit produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow upward in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisania.

# How to grow Bananas?
To grow bananas, follow these steps:

1. Choose the right variety: There are many different varieties of bananas, so select one that suits your climate and growing conditions. 

2. Select a suitable location: Bananas thrive in warm and tropical climates. They require full sun exposure for at least six hours a day and protection from strong winds. 

3. Prepare the soil: Before planting, prepare the soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure to improve its fertility and drainage. 

4. Planting: Dig a hole that is twice the size of the root ball of the banana plant. Place the plant in the hole, making sure the top of the root ball is level with or slightly above the soil surface.

5. Watering: Bananas require regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water deeply once or twice a week, depending on the weather conditions. 

6. Fertilizing: Feed your banana plants with a balanced fertilizer every two to three months during the growing season.

7. Mulching: Apply a layer of organic mulch, such as straw or wood chips, around the base of the plant to help retain moisture, suppress weed growth, and maintain an even soil temperature.

8. Pruning: As the banana plant grows, remove any dead or damaged leaves to maintain a tidy appearance and prevent diseases. 

9. Protecting from cold: If you live in a region with cold winters, protect your banana plant by wrapping it in burlap or covering it with a frost blanket.

10. Harvesting: Bananas take around 9-12 months to mature and produce fruit. Harvest the bananas when they are fully grown but still green.
# Light
Full sun: Banana trees need full sun to thrive, or a minimum of six hours of direct sunlight per day. Indoors, keep your banana plant near a south-facing window and consider supplementing its growth with a grow light.
# Soil
The soil should have good drainage, adequate fertility and moisture. Deep, rich loamy and salty clay loam soil with pH between 6-7.5 is most preferred for banana cultivation. Ill drained, poorly aerated and nutritionally deficient soils are not suitable for banana.
# Water
Being a long duration crop, the total water requirements of banana are high. Water requirements-per year vary between 1200 mm in the humid tropics to 2200 in the dry tropics. For rainfed production, average rainfall of 2000 to 2500 mm per year, well-distributed, is desirable, but banana often grows under less rainfall.
# Temperature and Humidity
In order to attain the best quality ripe fruit bananas (20 cm) should be stored at 18oC and relative humidity during ripening must be 80 - 85%.
According to the US Department of Agriculture, the desired storage temperature for bananas is 56 to 58 degrees Fahrenheit. That means that bananas are best stored at room temperature—so your countertop really is the right place for them.
A humidity of at least 50%, preferably higher, is recommended since the banana plant is native to hot and humid parts of the world. Dry air will damage the banana leaves
# Fertilizers
The  banana requires regular fertilizer application because it is a heavy feeder. Most farmers use an 8-10-8 NPK (Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium) fertilizer. You can spread the fertilizer around the base of the trunk evenly once a month, avoiding getting in contact with it.
The best fertilizer for banana trees is one that is high in potassium, as bananas require a lot of potassium to grow and produce fruit. Other important nutrients for banana trees include nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium. A balanced fertilizer with a ratio of 5-10-10 or 8-12-12 is a good choice.
# Pests
 Banana aphids (Pentalonia nigronervosa)

  # Herbs
  Some common herbs that are often planted alongside banana trees include:

1. Lemongrass: Lemongrass is a fragrant herb that can help repel pests and insects that may harm banana plants. It also adds a citrusy flavor to dishes and can be used in teas and other beverages.

2. Basil: Basil is a versatile herb that pairs well with bananas and can be used in both sweet and savory recipes. It can also attract beneficial insects and provide some shade for the banana plants.

3. Mint: Mint is a cooling herb that can add a refreshing flavor to banana-based desserts and beverages. It also has insect-repellent properties and can help deter pests from the banana plants.

4. Comfrey: Comfrey is a medicinal herb that can be used as a natural fertilizer for banana plants. Its deep roots help bring up nutrients from the soil, making them available to the bananas.

5. Marigold: Marigolds are often planted as companion plants for bananas because they can repel nematodes, which are microscopic worms that can damage the roots of banana plants.

6. Nasturtium: Nasturtiums are edible flowers that can add a pop of color to your garden. They are also known to attract beneficial insects and deter pests, making them a good companion plant for bananas.

7. Chives: Chives are a member of the onion family and can help deter pests from banana plants. They also have a mild onion flavor that can complement the taste of bananas in certain dishes.

These are just a few examples of herbs that are commonly planted alongside banana trees. The specific herbs you choose may depend on your personal preferences, local climate, and the specific needs of your banana plants.
# Herbicides
Some common herbicides used for weed control in banana plantations include:

1. Glyphosate: Glyphosate-based herbicides are commonly used to control a wide range of weeds in banana plantations. They are effective against both broadleaf and grassy weeds.

2. Paraquat: Paraquat is a non-selective herbicide that is often used as a spot treatment for controlling weeds in banana fields. It is fast-acting and can kill weeds on contact.

3. Atrazine: Atrazine is a selective herbicide that is effective against grassy weeds in banana plantations. It is often used in pre-emergent applications to prevent weed growth.

4. 2,4-D: 2,4-D is a selective herbicide that targets broadleaf weeds in banana fields. It is commonly used to control weeds like pigweed, lambsquarters, and dandelions.

5. Diuron: Diuron is a pre-emergent herbicide that is often used to control annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in banana plantations. It can provide long-lasting weed control.

It is important to note that the use of herbicides should be done following proper guidelines and regulations, as misuse or overuse can have negative impacts on the environment and human health. It is always recommended to consult with a professional or local agricultural extension office for guidance on herbicide use in banana plantations.
# Toxicity
## What substances are toxic in bananas?
Cadmium and mercury are majorly responsible for increased toxicity of CaC2 treated banana.
# Harvesting
Bananas are harvested raw and ripened artificially. The dwarf bananas are ready for harvest within 11- 14 months after planting, while tall cultivars take about 14-16 months to harvest. A bunch usually takes 90-120 days to mature after shooting, depending on climate and cultural practices.
# Pruning
## What is pruning in Apple?
By cutting back damaged and unproductive areas, you make way for new, healthy growth to emerge. Pruning also helps improve your harvest the following season.

What is the best time to prune banana trees?
The best time to prune a banana tree is during the active growing season and after it bears fruit.

## PROCESS 
Brown, yellowing and damaged leaves draw energy away from your banana tree that could be put toward new growth or better – more fruits. By cutting back damaged and unproductive areas, you make way for new, healthy growth to emerge. Pruning also helps improve your harvest the following season
# Crop Distance
The required distance for banana trees in a plantation depends on the specific variety of banana being grown and the cultivation practices being employed. However, a general guideline for spacing banana trees is typically around 3 to 4 meters (10 to 13 feet) between plants in a row and 2 to 3 meters (6 to 10 feet) between rows. This spacing allows for adequate air circulation, sunlight penetration, and access for management practices such as pruning and harvesting.

It is important to consider the specific requirements of the banana variety being grown, as some may require more or less space depending on their growth habits and size. Additionally, local climate conditions, soil fertility, and management practices can also influence the optimal spacing for banana trees.

Consulting with local agricultural experts or extension offices is recommended to determine the most suitable spacing for banana trees based on the specific conditions and variety being cultivated.
