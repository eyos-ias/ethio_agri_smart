# What's Banana?
A banana is an elongated, edible fruit produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow upward in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisania.

# How to grow Bananas?
To grow bananas, follow these steps:

1. Choose the right variety: There are many different varieties of bananas, so select one that suits your climate and growing conditions. 

2. Select a suitable location: Bananas thrive in warm and tropical climates. They require full sun exposure for at least six hours a day and protection from strong winds. 

3. Prepare the soil: Before planting, prepare the soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure to improve its fertility and drainage. 

4. Planting: Dig a hole that is twice the size of the root ball of the banana plant. Place the plant in the hole, making sure the top of the root ball is level with or slightly above the soil surface.

5. Watering: Bananas require regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water deeply once or twice a week, depending on the weather conditions. 

6. Fertilizing: Feed your banana plants with a balanced fertilizer every two to three months during the growing season.

7. Mulching: Apply a layer of organic mulch, such as straw or wood chips, around the base of the plant to help retain moisture, suppress weed growth, and maintain an even soil temperature.

8. Pruning: As the banana plant grows, remove any dead or damaged leaves to maintain a tidy appearance and prevent diseases. 

9. Protecting from cold: If you live in a region with cold winters, protect your banana plant by wrapping it in burlap or covering it with a frost blanket.

10. Harvesting: Bananas take around 9-12 months to mature and produce fruit. Harvest the bananas when they are fully grown but still green.
# Light
Full sun: Banana trees need full sun to thrive, or a minimum of six hours of direct sunlight per day. Indoors, keep your banana plant near a south-facing window and consider supplementing its growth with a grow light.
# Soil
The soil should have good drainage, adequate fertility and moisture. Deep, rich loamy and salty clay loam soil with pH between 6-7.5 is most preferred for banana cultivation. Ill drained, poorly aerated and nutritionally deficient soils are not suitable for banana.
# Water
Being a long duration crop, the total water requirements of banana are high. Water requirements-per year vary between 1200 mm in the humid tropics to 2200 in the dry tropics. For rainfed production, average rainfall of 2000 to 2500 mm per year, well-distributed, is desirable, but banana often grows under less rainfall.
# Temperature and Humidity
In order to attain the best quality ripe fruit bananas (20 cm) should be stored at 18oC and relative humidity during ripening must be 80 - 85%.
According to the US Department of Agriculture, the desired storage temperature for bananas is 56 to 58 degrees Fahrenheit. That means that bananas are best stored at room temperature—so your countertop really is the right place for them.
A humidity of at least 50%, preferably higher, is recommended since the banana plant is native to hot and humid parts of the world. Dry air will damage the banana leaves
# Fertilizers
The  banana requires regular fertilizer application because it is a heavy feeder. Most farmers use an 8-10-8 NPK (Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium) fertilizer. You can spread the fertilizer around the base of the trunk evenly once a month, avoiding getting in contact with it.
The best fertilizer for banana trees is one that is high in potassium, as bananas require a lot of potassium to grow and produce fruit. Other important nutrients for banana trees include nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium. A balanced fertilizer with a ratio of 5-10-10 or 8-12-12 is a good choice.
# Possible Disease of Banana
## Virus
Bananas can be affected by several viral diseases. Here are some common viral diseases that can impact banana plants:

Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV): BBTV is one of the most devastating viral diseases affecting bananas. It is transmitted by banana aphids and causes stunted growth, yellowing, and twisting of leaves. Infected plants produce small, deformed bunches with tightly compacted bracts.

Banana streak virus (BSV): BSV is a widespread virus that causes dark streaks or necrotic lesions on the leaves and fruit of infected banana plants. It can result in reduced fruit quality and yield.

Banana mosaic virus (BMV): BMV causes mosaic patterns, leaf distortion, and yellowing of leaves in infected banana plants. It can affect fruit development and overall plant health.

Banana bract mosaic virus (BBrMV): BBrMV causes mosaic patterns, yellowing, and necrotic lesions on the bracts (protective coverings) of banana flowers. It can result in reduced fruit yield and quality.

Banana mild mosaic virus (BanMMV): BanMMV causes mild mosaic symptoms on banana leaves, including light and dark green mosaic patterns. It can lead to reduced plant vigor and productivity.

Banana virus X (BVX): BVX causes yellowing, mosaic patterns, and necrotic lesions on the leaves of infected banana plants. It can negatively impact fruit quality and yield.
# Fungus
Bananas can be susceptible to various fungal diseases. Here are some common fungal diseases that can affect banana plants:

Panama disease (Fusarium wilt): Panama disease, caused by the soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, is one of the most destructive diseases of bananas. It affects the vascular system of the plant, causing wilting, yellowing, and eventually death of the plant. There are different races of the fungus that affect different banana cultivars.

Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis): Black Sigatoka is a leaf spot disease caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis. It affects the leaves of banana plants, causing dark, elongated lesions that coalesce over time. Severe infections can lead to defoliation and reduced fruit yield.

Anthracnose (Colletotrichum musae): Anthracnose is a fungal disease that affects banana fruit. It causes dark, sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which can lead to rotting. Anthracnose is more prevalent in areas with high humidity and rainfall.

Crown rot (Various fungal pathogens): Crown rot is a disease that affects the base of the banana plant, usually caused by various fungal pathogens such as Fusarium spp., Phytophthora spp., and Pythium spp. It leads to the decay and rotting of the pseudostem and roots, resulting in plant wilting and death.

Sigatoka leaf spot (Mycosphaerella musicola): Sigatoka leaf spot, caused by Mycosphaerella musicola, is another fungal disease that affects banana leaves. It causes yellow or tan spots with dark brown margins on the leaves, which can lead to defoliation and reduced photosynthesis.

Root rot (Various fungal pathogens): Root rot can be caused by several fungal pathogens, including Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia spp., and Phytophthora spp. It affects the roots and can lead to plant wilting, stunted growth, and eventual death.
# Bacteria
Bananas can be affected by bacterial diseases, although they are relatively less common compared to fungal and viral diseases. Here are some bacterial diseases that can affect banana plants:

Bacterial wilt (Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum): Bacterial wilt, also known as Moko disease, is a significant bacterial disease affecting bananas. It is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum. The disease primarily affects the vascular system of the plant, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual death of the plant. Infected plants may exhibit oozing of bacterial exudates from cut stems.

Bacterial crown rot (Erwinia spp., Pseudomonas spp.): Bacterial crown rot affects the base of the banana plant and is caused by various bacterial pathogens, including species of Erwinia and Pseudomonas. It leads to the rotting of the pseudostem and roots, resulting in plant wilting, yellowing, and death.

Bacterial leaf spot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum): Bacterial leaf spot, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum, results in the development of small, water-soaked lesions on the leaves of banana plants. As the disease progresses, the lesions may turn dark brown or black and coalesce. Severe infections can lead to defoliation and reduced plant vigor.

Bacterial soft rot (Erwinia spp.): Bacterial soft rot affects bananas after harvest and is caused by various species of Erwinia. It causes the breakdown of tissues in the fruit, resulting in soft, watery decay with an unpleasant odor.
# Pre-Prevention of Disease of Banana
