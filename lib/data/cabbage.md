# What's Cabbage?
Cabbage is highly nutritious vegetable. Cabbages are rich in vitamin C, fiber, and vitamin K. They may help with heart and digestive health. Cabbage, which is often lumped into the same category as lettuce because of their similar appearance, is actually a part of the cruciferous vegetable family.
# Names
1,Scientific/Botanical name : Brassica oleracea (Capitata Group).

2,Common name:  Brassica oleracea (Capitata Group), commonly known as cabbage.

Toxicity: Forage nitrate levels of 0.5% and above are potentially dangerous, with acute poisoning likely to occur if the nitrate level exceeds 1%.
# How to grow Cabbages?
To grow cabbage, follow these steps:
1. Choose a suitable location: Cabbage prefers full sun, so select a spot in your garden that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. 

2. Prepare the soil: Remove any weeds or debris from the planting area. Loosen the soil to a depth of 12-15 inches using a garden fork or tiller. 

3. Start seeds indoors (optional): If you want an early start, you can start cabbage seeds indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date. Use seed trays or small pots filled with seed-starting mix. 

4. Direct sowing: Alternatively, you can directly sow cabbage seeds in the garden once the soil temperature reaches around 45°F (7°C). 

5. Watering: Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Cabbage requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. 

6. Fertilization: Apply a balanced fertilizer or compost around the base of the cabbage plants about three weeks after transplanting or when seedlings are well-established.

7. Pest control: Monitor your cabbage plants regularly for any signs of pests such as aphids, caterpillars, or slugs.

8. Weed control: Keep the area around your cabbage plants weed-free to prevent competition for nutrients and water.

9. Harvesting: Cabbage is typically ready for harvest around 80-100 days after planting, depending on the variety. Harvest the heads when they reach a firm, solid consistency and have reached the desired size.
# Light
Use steps to plant, from our “Planting Your Cabbage” page. Once your cabbage is planted: Let the sunshine in: Cabbages need full sun – at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight per day. Water wisely: It's best to water in the morning and at the base of the plant (soil level) keeping the foliage dry.
# Soil
## Sandy loams
Cabbage may be grown on a variety of soils but it does best on a well- drained, loam soil well supplied with organic matter. Sandy loams are preferred for early crops. Adjust soil pH to 6.5 - 7.0 for maximum yields.
# Water
Water cabbage deeply and infrequently while trying to maintain even soil moisture. About 1-2 inches of water are required per week. Use drip irrigation if possible to conserve water. Applying mulch around the plant also helps conserve soil moisture and reduces weed growth.
# Temperature and Humidity
Cabbage prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55-75°F (13-24°C), optimum being 60-70°F (16-21°C), but will produce good crops under warmer, summer conditions. FALL CROP: Use midseason and storage varieties. Start seedlings as above in May and transplant to the garden in June-July.
Humidity. A cabbage is approximately 92% water. From the time of harvest it is important to cool the cabbage as quickly as possible and maintain a relative humidity of at least 90% or higher. Relative humidities below 80% will result in moisture loss and unacceptable shrinkage of the heads.
# Fertilizers
A diluted solution of a balanced (10-10-10) liquid fertilizer, weak compost tea, or fish emulsion is recommended. This can be repeated every two weeks. Once cabbage plants have been transplanted into a prepared garden bed, continue applying cabbage fertilizer every three to four weeks until heads begin to form.
To produce optimum yields of good quality cabbages, often high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer are applied.

   # Herbs
   Some common herbs that can be planted alongside cabbage include:

1. Dill: Dill is a herb that can attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and wasps, which can help control pests that commonly affect cabbage plants.

2. Chamomile: Chamomile has natural fungicidal properties and can help prevent fungal diseases that may affect cabbage plants.

3. Thyme: Thyme is known for its strong aroma, which can help repel pests like cabbage worms and aphids.

4. Sage: Sage has antimicrobial properties and can help prevent diseases in cabbage plants. It also attracts pollinators like bees.

5. Oregano: Oregano has strong aromatic compounds that can deter pests like cabbage moths and cabbage loopers.

6. Nasturtium: Nasturtium is a flowering plant that can act as a trap crop, attracting pests away from cabbage plants. Its flowers are also edible and can be used in salads.

7. Marigold: Marigold flowers emit a strong scent that repels pests like aphids and nematodes. They also attract beneficial insects like ladybugs.
# Herbicides
Some common herbicides used for cabbage include:

1. Glyphosate: Glyphosate is a widely used herbicide that effectively kills a broad range of weeds. It is commonly used as a non-selective herbicide to control both grasses and broadleaf weeds in cabbage fields.

2. Atrazine: Atrazine is a selective herbicide that targets broadleaf weeds and grasses. It is often used in cabbage cultivation to control weeds like pigweed, lambsquarters, and foxtail.

3. Pendimethalin: Pendimethalin is a pre-emergent herbicide that prevents weed seeds from germinating. It is commonly used in cabbage fields before planting to create a weed-free environment for the young cabbage plants.

4. Metolachlor: Metolachlor is another pre-emergent herbicide that provides effective control against annual grasses and some broadleaf weeds. It is often used in combination with other herbicides for comprehensive weed control in cabbage fields.

5. 2,4-D: 2,4-D is a selective herbicide that targets broadleaf weeds. It is commonly used in cabbage cultivation to control weeds like dandelions, chickweed, and clover.


# Toxicity
 The concentration of nitrates in cabbages can vary considerably and may be as much as 1.2 g/kg fresh weight and these levels have the potential to cause toxic effects in ruminants . Nitrites induce poisoning due to fatal anoxia when methemoglobin, with a much lower capacity to carry oxygen, is formed .



# Harvesting
Harvest when heads reach desired size and are firm. Mature heads left on the stem may split. Days to maturity is around 70 days for most green cabbage varieties, and most produce 1- to 3-pound heads. To harvest, cut each cabbage head at its base with a sharp knife.
# Pruning
You can prune your Cabbage any time you notice dead, diseased, or damaged leaves during the growing season. Once you notice such a leave, locate an unwanted leaf, then follow its stem all the way to the bottom of petiole. Removing dead stems will increase the light and ventilation of the plant and help it to grow.

## What is the best time to prune Cabbages?
Spring and Summer.
# Crop Distance
The required distance for planting cabbage plants can vary depending on the specific variety and growing conditions. However, a general guideline for spacing cabbage plants is to allow approximately 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) between each plant. This spacing allows enough room for the cabbage heads to develop properly and ensures adequate air circulation to reduce the risk of disease.

It is also important to consider the final size of the cabbage heads when determining spacing. Larger varieties may require more space between plants compared to smaller varieties.

Additionally, rows of cabbage plants should be spaced approximately 24-36 inches (60-90 cm) apart to allow for ease of cultivation and harvesting.

Always refer to the specific recommendations provided by the seed packet or seedling supplier for the ideal spacing requirements for the particular cabbage variety you are growing
