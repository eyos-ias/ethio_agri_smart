# How to grow Cabbages?

To grow cabbage, follow these steps:
1. Choose a suitable location: Cabbage prefers full sun, so select a spot in your garden that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. 

2. Prepare the soil: Remove any weeds or debris from the planting area. Loosen the soil to a depth of 12-15 inches using a garden fork or tiller. 

3. Start seeds indoors (optional): If you want an early start, you can start cabbage seeds indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date. Use seed trays or small pots filled with seed-starting mix. 

4. Direct sowing: Alternatively, you can directly sow cabbage seeds in the garden once the soil temperature reaches around 45°F (7°C). 

5. Watering: Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Cabbage requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. 

6. Fertilization: Apply a balanced fertilizer or compost around the base of the cabbage plants about three weeks after transplanting or when seedlings are well-established.

7. Pest control: Monitor your cabbage plants regularly for any signs of pests such as aphids, caterpillars, or slugs.

8. Weed control: Keep the area around your cabbage plants weed-free to prevent competition for nutrients and water.

9. Harvesting: Cabbage is typically ready for harvest around 80-100 days after planting, depending on the variety. Harvest the heads when they reach a firm, solid consistency and have reached the desired size.
# Light
Use steps to plant, from our “Planting Your Cabbage” page. Once your cabbage is planted: Let the sunshine in: Cabbages need full sun – at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight per day. Water wisely: It's best to water in the morning and at the base of the plant (soil level) keeping the foliage dry.
# Soil

Cabbages prefer well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. The soil should have a pH level between 6.0 and 6.8, which is slightly acidic to neutral. Cabbages also require a soil that is fertile and has good moisture retention capabilities. Adding compost or well-rotted manure to the soil before planting can help improve its fertility and moisture-holding capacity. Additionally, cabbages benefit from a soil that is loose and friable, allowing for easy root penetration and growth.

Cabbage may be grown on a variety of soils but it does best on a well- drained, loam soil well supplied with organic matter. Sandy loams are preferred for early crops. Adjust soil pH to 6.5 - 7.0 for maximum yields.
# Water
Water cabbage deeply and infrequently while trying to maintain even soil moisture. About 1-2 inches of water are required per week. Use drip irrigation if possible to conserve water. Applying mulch around the plant also helps conserve soil moisture and reduces weed growth.
# Temperature and Humidity
Cabbage prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55-75°F (13-24°C), optimum being 60-70°F (16-21°C), but will produce good crops under warmer, summer conditions. FALL CROP: Use midseason and storage varieties. Start seedlings as above in May and transplant to the garden in June-July.
Humidity. A cabbage is approximately 92% water. From the time of harvest it is important to cool the cabbage as quickly as possible and maintain a relative humidity of at least 90% or higher. Relative humidities below 80% will result in moisture loss and unacceptable shrinkage of the heads.
# Fertilizers
A diluted solution of a balanced (10-10-10) liquid fertilizer, weak compost tea, or fish emulsion is recommended. This can be repeated every two weeks. Once cabbage plants have been transplanted into a prepared garden bed, continue applying cabbage fertilizer every three to four weeks until heads begin to form.
To produce optimum yields of good quality cabbages, often high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer are applied.
# Possible Disease of Cabbage
## Virus
There are several viral diseases that can affect cabbage plants. Here are a few examples:

1. Cabbage mosaic virus (CaMV): CaMV is a common viral disease in cabbage and other cruciferous plants. It causes mosaic patterns of light and dark green on the leaves, along with curling and distortion. Infected plants may also exhibit stunted growth.

2. Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV): TuMV is another viral disease that affects cabbage. It causes mosaic patterns on the leaves, along with yellowing, blistering, and distortion. Severely infected plants may have reduced yields and stunted growth.

3. Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV): CaMV can also infect cabbage plants, not just cauliflower. It causes mosaic patterns and yellowing of the leaves, as well as stunted growth and reduced head formation.

4. Beet yellows virus (BYV): BYV is a viral disease that affects cabbage and other brassica crops. It causes yellowing and curling of the leaves, stunted growth, and reduced yields.

5. Lettuce mosaic virus (LMV): Although primarily affecting lettuce, LMV can also infect cabbage and other cruciferous plants. It causes mosaic patterns, leaf distortion, and stunted growth
## Fungus
Here are some common fungal diseases that can affect cabbage:

1. Black rot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris): Black rot is a bacterial disease, not a fungal one. I apologize for the error in my previous response.

2. Alternaria leaf spot (Alternaria spp.): Alternaria leaf spot is caused by fungi belonging to the Alternaria genus. It leads to the development of circular, dark lesions on the leaves, which may expand as the infection progresses. Severe infections can cause defoliation and impact the overall health of the plant.

3. Fusarium yellows (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans): Fusarium yellows is a fungal disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans. It causes yellowing, wilting, and stunting of the plants, often accompanied by dark streaks on the stem.

4. Clubroot (Plasmodiophora brassicae): Clubroot is a soil-borne disease caused by the Plasmodiophora brassicae fungus. It leads to the formation of swollen, distorted roots, and stunted growth of the plant. The affected plants may exhibit yellowing, wilting, and overall poor health.

5. Powdery mildew (Erysiphe cruciferarum): Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that can affect cabbage plants. It appears as a white, powdery growth on the leaves, stems, and heads of the plant. Severe infections can lead to leaf curling, distortion, and reduced photosynthesis.

6. Downy mildew (Hyaloperonospora parasitica): Downy mildew is caused by the pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica. It results in the appearance of yellow or pale green patches on the upper leaf surface, with a gray or purplish fungal growth on the undersides.

## Bacteria
Here are some common bacterial diseases that can affect cabbage:

1. Bacterial soft rot (Pectobacterium spp. and Dickeya spp.): Bacterial soft rot is a common bacterial disease that affects cabbage and other cruciferous crops. It is caused by various species of bacteria, including Pectobacterium carotovorum and Dickeya spp. It causes water-soaked lesions on the leaves and heads, which develop into soft, slimy decay. The affected tissues may have a foul odor.

2. Blackleg (Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum): Blackleg is caused by the bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. It leads to dark, sunken lesions on the stem and leaves of cabbage plants, which can cause wilting and plant death.

3. Bacterial leaf spot (Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola): Bacterial leaf spot is caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola. It causes small, dark, and angular lesions on the leaves of cabbage plants. The lesions may coalesce and lead to defoliation if the infection is severe.

4. Bacterial head rot (Pseudomonas spp. and Xanthomonas spp.): Bacterial head rot is caused by various species of bacteria, including Pseudomonas spp. and Xanthomonas spp. It causes rotting and decay of the cabbage heads, often starting at the base and spreading inward. The affected heads may have a foul odor and become mushy.
# Pre-pervention of Disease of Cabbage
Here are some pre-preventio strategies to   consider:

1. First and foremost, it is crucial to begin with healthy and disease-resistant cabbage varieties. Choosing disease-resistant cultivars can significantly reduce the risk of infection. Consult with your local nursery or agricultural extension service for recommendations specific to your region.

2. Next, ensure that your cabbage plants are grown in the right conditions. Cabbage thrives in cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Proper spacing between plants promotes good airflow, reducing the chances of disease spread.

3. To prevent diseases from taking hold, sanitation is key. Regularly remove any infected or yellowing leaves, as they can harbor pathogens. Avoid working with your cabbage plants when they are wet, as moisture can facilitate disease transmission.

4. Crop rotation is another effective practice to prevent diseases. Avoid planting cabbage or related crops, such as broccoli or cauliflower, in the same location for consecutive seasons. This helps to break the disease cycle and reduce the buildup of soil-borne pathogens.

5. Lastly, consider using organic or chemical treatments as a preventive measure. Consult with a horticulturist or agricultural expert to identify suitable options for your specific disease concerns. Remember to carefully follow the instructions provided to ensure safe and effective application.
# Post-prevention of Disease of Cabbage
Here are some post-prevention strategies to  consider:
1.  First and foremost, regular monitoring is essential. Keep a close eye on your cabbage plants for any signs of disease or pest infestation. Early detection allows for swift action and minimizes the potential damage.

2. If you do encounter any diseased plants, promptly remove them from the garden. This prevents the spread of pathogens to healthy plants nearby. Remember to dispose of infected plant material properly, away from your growing area.

3. Maintaining proper watering practices is crucial. Overwatering can create favorable conditions for diseases to thrive. Water your cabbage plants at the base, avoiding wetting the foliage excessively. Additionally, ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogged soil.

4. Consider applying organic or chemical treatments if necessary. These can help control diseases and pests that may have managed to infiltrate your cabbage plants. Consult with a knowledgeable horticulturist or agricultural expert who can guide you in choosing the appropriate treatments for your specific needs.

5. Implementing crop rotation is still beneficial, even after prevention measures have been taken. By rotating cabbage with other unrelated crops in subsequent growing seasons, you reduce the risk of disease recurrence and maintain a healthier soil ecosystem.

6. Lastly, continue practicing good sanitation habits. Regularly remove any dead leaves or plant debris from your garden to minimize potential disease reservoirs. Clean your gardening tools after each use to prevent disease transmission.

# Pests
 Here are some common pests that affect cabbages:

1. Cabbage Worms: Cabbage worms, including the imported cabbage worm and cabbage looper, are caterpillars that feed on cabbage leaves, causing chewed and ragged foliage.

2. Cabbage Aphids: Aphids are small, soft-bodied insects that cluster on the undersides of cabbage leaves and suck sap from the plants. They can cause stunted growth and distorted leaves.

3. Cabbage Root Maggots: The larvae of cabbage root maggots feed on the roots of cabbage plants, resulting in wilting, yellowing, and stunted growth. They can cause significant damage, especially to young plants.

4. Diamondback Moths: The larvae of diamondback moths are small, green caterpillars that feed on cabbage leaves, causing extensive damage and creating small, irregular holes.

5. Flea Beetles: Flea beetles are small, jumping beetles that chew small holes in cabbage leaves, giving them a "shot-hole" appearance. Severe infestations can lead to stunted growth and reduced yields.

6. Slugs and Snails: Slugs and snails are mollusks that feed on cabbage leaves, leaving large irregular holes and slime trails. They are most active during cool and moist conditions.

7. Cabbage White Butterflies: Adult cabbage white butterflies lay eggs on cabbage leaves, and the resulting caterpillars (cabbage worms) can cause extensive damage by feeding on the leaves.

8. Cutworms: Cutworms are nocturnal caterpillars that cut through the stems of young cabbage plants near the soil surface, causing the plants to wilt and die.

# Pesticides
 Here are some commonly used pesticides for managing pests on cabbages:

1. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt): Bt is a naturally occurring soil bacteria that produces proteins toxic to certain caterpillars, including cabbage worms. It is available in various formulations and is widely used as a biological pesticide for controlling caterpillar pests on cabbages.

2. Neem Oil: Neem oil is derived from the seeds of the neem tree and acts as a broad-spectrum insecticide and repellent. It can be effective against aphids, cabbage worms, and other cabbage pests. Neem oil works by disrupting the feeding and reproduction of insects.

3. Pyrethrin: Pyrethrins are natural insecticides derived from chrysanthemum flowers. They are effective against a wide range of insects, including cabbage worms, aphids, and flea beetles. Pyrethrin-based products have low toxicity to humans and break down rapidly in the environment.

4. Spinosad: Spinosad is a naturally occurring compound derived from the bacteria Saccharopolyspora spinosa. It is effective against caterpillars, thrips, and other pests. Spinosad products are considered relatively safe for beneficial insects and have low toxicity to mammals.

5. Insecticidal Soaps: Insecticidal soaps are contact insecticides that work by suffocating soft-bodied insects such as aphids, whiteflies, and cabbage worms. They can be an effective option for controlling these pests on cabbages.


   # Herbs
   Some common herbs that can be planted alongside cabbage include:

1. Dill: Dill is a herb that can attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and wasps, which can help control pests that commonly affect cabbage plants.

2. Chamomile: Chamomile has natural fungicidal properties and can help prevent fungal diseases that may affect cabbage plants.

3. Thyme: Thyme is known for its strong aroma, which can help repel pests like cabbage worms and aphids.

4. Sage: Sage has antimicrobial properties and can help prevent diseases in cabbage plants. It also attracts pollinators like bees.

5. Oregano: Oregano has strong aromatic compounds that can deter pests like cabbage moths and cabbage loopers.

6. Nasturtium: Nasturtium is a flowering plant that can act as a trap crop, attracting pests away from cabbage plants. Its flowers are also edible and can be used in salads.

7. Marigold: Marigold flowers emit a strong scent that repels pests like aphids and nematodes. They also attract beneficial insects like ladybugs.
# Herbicides
Some common herbicides used for cabbage include:

1. Glyphosate: Glyphosate is a widely used herbicide that effectively kills a broad range of weeds. It is commonly used as a non-selective herbicide to control both grasses and broadleaf weeds in cabbage fields.

2. Atrazine: Atrazine is a selective herbicide that targets broadleaf weeds and grasses. It is often used in cabbage cultivation to control weeds like pigweed, lambsquarters, and foxtail.

3. Pendimethalin: Pendimethalin is a pre-emergent herbicide that prevents weed seeds from germinating. It is commonly used in cabbage fields before planting to create a weed-free environment for the young cabbage plants.

4. Metolachlor: Metolachlor is another pre-emergent herbicide that provides effective control against annual grasses and some broadleaf weeds. It is often used in combination with other herbicides for comprehensive weed control in cabbage fields.

5. 2,4-D: 2,4-D is a selective herbicide that targets broadleaf weeds. It is commonly used in cabbage cultivation to control weeds like dandelions, chickweed, and clover.


# Toxicity
 The concentration of nitrates in cabbages can vary considerably and may be as much as 1.2 g/kg fresh weight and these levels have the potential to cause toxic effects in ruminants . Nitrites induce poisoning due to fatal anoxia when methemoglobin, with a much lower capacity to carry oxygen, is formed .



# Harvesting
Harvest when heads reach desired size and are firm. Mature heads left on the stem may split. Days to maturity is around 70 days for most green cabbage varieties, and most produce 1- to 3-pound heads. To harvest, cut each cabbage head at its base with a sharp knife.
# Pruning
You can prune your Cabbage any time you notice dead, diseased, or damaged leaves during the growing season. Once you notice such a leave, locate an unwanted leaf, then follow its stem all the way to the bottom of petiole. Removing dead stems will increase the light and ventilation of the plant and help it to grow.

## What is the best time to prune Cabbages?
Cabbages prefer well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. The soil should have a pH level between 6.0 and 6.8, which is slightly acidic to neutral. Cabbages also require a soil that is fertile and has good moisture retention capabilities. Adding compost or well-rotted manure to the soil before planting can help improve its fertility and moisture-holding capacity. Additionally, cabbages benefit from a soil that is loose and friable, allowing for easy root penetration and growth.
# Crop Distance
The required distance for planting cabbage plants can vary depending on the specific variety and growing conditions. However, a general guideline for spacing cabbage plants is to allow approximately 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) between each plant. This spacing allows enough room for the cabbage heads to develop properly and ensures adequate air circulation to reduce the risk of disease.

It is also important to consider the final size of the cabbage heads when determining spacing. Larger varieties may require more space between plants compared to smaller varieties.

Additionally, rows of cabbage plants should be spaced approximately 24-36 inches (60-90 cm) apart to allow for ease of cultivation and harvesting.

Always refer to the specific recommendations provided by the seed packet or seedling supplier for the ideal spacing requirements for the particular cabbage variety you are growing
