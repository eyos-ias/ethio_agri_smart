5. Pendimethalin: Pendimethalin is a pre-emergence herbicide effective against many annual grasses and broadleaf weeds.

6. Diquat: Diquat is a contact herbicide used for post-emergence weed control in potatoes. It acts quickly on contact with foliage and desiccates the plants. 
# Toxicity
Potatoes are generally safe to eat and are a staple food for many people around the world. However, certain parts of the potato plant, such as the leaves, stems, and green skin, contain natural toxins known as glycoalkaloids, with the predominant glycoalkaloid being solanine. These toxins serve as a natural defense mechanism for the plant against pests and diseases.

Consuming large quantities of glycoalkaloids can be toxic and may cause adverse effects. Symptoms of glycoalkaloid poisoning can include gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), neurological effects (headaches, confusion, hallucinations), and in severe cases, respiratory and circulatory issues.


# Harvesting
 Here is a general overview of the potato harvesting process:

1. Timing: Potatoes are usually harvested when the plants have completed their growth cycle and have started to naturally senesce or die back. This is typically around 70 to 120 days after planting, depending on the potato variety and growing conditions.

2. Preparation: Before harvesting, it's recommended to stop watering the plants for about two weeks. This helps to toughen the skin of the potatoes and allows them to mature and store better. 

3. Digging: Potatoes can be harvested by hand or with the assistance of machinery. For small-scale or home gardens, a garden fork or shovel can be used to carefully dig around the base of the plants, loosening the soil and exposing the tubers. 

4. Gathering: Once the potatoes are exposed, gently lift them from the soil. Remove any excess soil by hand, being careful not to bruise or damage the tubers. 

5. Curing: After harvesting, allow the potatoes to dry and cure for a few hours to a few days in a cool, well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight.

6. Storage: Once the potatoes are cured, they can be stored for future use. Store them in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated location, such as a root cellar or cool basement, to help maintain their quality and prevent sprouting or spoilage.

# Pruning
Potatoes do not require pruning in the same way that some other plants, like fruit trees or grapevines, do. However, there are a few practices related to potato plants that can be considered "pruning" in a broad sense. Here are a couple of relevant techniques:

1. Removal of Suckers: Potato plants can produce side shoots or "suckers" that emerge from the base of the plant or leaf axils. These suckers can divert energy from the main plant and result in smaller tubers. 

2. Removal of Diseased Foliage: If you notice any signs of disease or pest infestation on the foliage of your potato plants, it can be beneficial to remove the affected leaves.


##  What time  is best  for pruning?
Here are some guidelines regarding the timing of these pruning activities:

1. Removal of Suckers: Suckers, which are the side shoots that emerge from the base of the potato plant or leaf axils, can be removed throughout the growing season. It is generally recommended to remove suckers when they are small and easily manageable. Regularly inspect your potato plants and pinch or cut off any suckers that are diverting energy from the main plant.

2. Removal of Diseased Foliage: If you notice any signs of disease or pest infestation on the foliage of your potato plants, it's best to remove the affected leaves promptly. This helps prevent the spread of diseases and can improve the overall health of the plants. Remove the diseased foliage as soon as you notice it, regardless of the time of year.


#  Crop Distance

The spacing between potato plants can significantly impact the yield and quality of the crop. Proper spacing allows each plant to receive adequate sunlight, nutrients, and water, promoting optimal growth and tuber development. The specific spacing requirements may vary depending on the potato variety, soil fertility, and local growing conditions. However, here are some general guidelines for spacing potato plants:

1. Row Spacing: Potato plants are typically grown in rows. The row spacing, which is the distance between rows, can range from 30 to 90 centimeters (12 to 36 inches) or more, depending on the equipment used for cultivation and the available space. Wider row spacing allows for easier access and maintenance, while narrower spacing can maximize land use but may require more precise cultivation practices.

2. In-Row Spacing: The spacing between individual potato plants within a row is important for optimal growth and tuber development. The recommended in-row spacing varies depending on the potato variety and the desired tuber size. Here are some general guidelines:
