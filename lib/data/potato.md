#  Crop Distance

The spacing between coffee plants is important to allow for adequate air circulation, sunlight exposure, and ease of management. Sufficient spacing promotes the healthy growth of coffee plants, prevents overcrowding, and reduces the risk of disease spread.

The specific spacing recommendations can vary based on factors such as the coffee variety's growth habit (whether it is a compact or spreading variety), the desired canopy density, and the local climate conditions. In some regions or specific production systems, closer spacing may be employed to maximize land utilization or for specific management practices.
