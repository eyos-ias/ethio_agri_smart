Pruning
The first time to prune carrots is just after they germinate. This is the time when you can identify the stronger shoots from the weaker ones. After the weak plants are discerned, prune their tops in a process called thinning to prevent them from growing. Carrots are thinned again when the shoots reach 1 to 3 inches.
