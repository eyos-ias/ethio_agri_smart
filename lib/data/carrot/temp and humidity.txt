Temperature and Humidity
Temperatures above 80째F reduce seed germination. Carrots grow best when temperatures do not exceed 75째F. Temperatures down to 32째F do not seriously damage plants. High summer temperatures reduce growth, decrease quality, and cause bitter or off-flavors to develop.
Carrots should be stored with their tops removed in a cold (32째F) and humid (98-100% relative humidity) storage condition. In order to achieve high humidity, you will probably need to store your carrots in a plastic bag.
