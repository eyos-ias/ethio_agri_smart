Fertilizers
For Carrot plants, it is best to choose a fertilizer low in nitrogen and high in phosphate and potassium. 0-10-10 or 5-15-15 fertilizer will work well for the Carrot plant. It is because potassium and phosphate promote root growth, and these nutrients will help their better growth.
The Jobe's Organics Vegetable Fertilizer spikes are one of the best carrot fertilizers and are perfect for Carrot growers.
