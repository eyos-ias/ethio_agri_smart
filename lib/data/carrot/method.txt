HOW to grow?
To grow carrots, follow these steps:
1. Choose a suitable location: Carrots prefer full sun but can tolerate some shade. Select a spot in your garden that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily.
2. Prepare the soil: Remove any weeds or debris from the planting area. Use a garden fork or tiller to loosen the soil to a depth of 12-15 inches. 
3. Sow the seeds: Carrot seeds are small and can be difficult to handle. Mix the seeds with some sand or vermiculite to help distribute them evenly. Sow the seeds directly into the prepared soil, about ¼ to ½ inch deep. 
4. Watering: Keep the soil consistently moist during the germination period, which typically takes 10-14 days. After germination, water deeply once a week, providing about 1 inch of water.
5. Thin the seedlings: Once the carrot seedlings reach about 2 inches tall, thin them out to provide enough space for each carrot to grow. Thin the seedlings to about 2-3 inches apart, depending on the desired size of the mature carrots.
6. Mulching: Apply a layer of organic mulch, such as straw or wood chips, around the carrot plants.
7. Fertilization: Carrots do not require heavy fertilization. However, you can apply a balanced fertilizer or compost around the base of the plants about 4-6 weeks after sowing to provide some additional nutrients.
8. Pest control: Monitor your carrot plants regularly for any signs of pests such as carrot flies or aphids.
9. Harvesting: Carrots are typically ready for harvest around 60-80 days after sowing, depending on the variety. Gently loosen the soil around the carrots and pull them out by grasping the tops near the soil line.
