Optimal temperature for Deglet Noor should not exceed 35° C, but most other varieties will permit higher levels, though not exceeding 50° C. Relative humidity also varies according to variety and the need to remove moisture or not.
The optimal temperature for storage during 6 or 12 months is 0ºC, depending on the variety (semidry dates like "Deglet Noor" and Halawi, have a longer period of life than other fresh dates like "Medjool' and " Bardhi'). At -18ºC (0ºF) the period of storage extends.
