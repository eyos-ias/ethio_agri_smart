Pest and disease
PESTS:The major date palm pests worldwide are the red palm weevil, date dust mite, dubas bug, lesser date moth, longhorn stem borer, almond moth and carob moth
PESTICIDES:Dates are often fumigated after harvest to eliminate contamination by pests. At one time methyl bromide was used, but it was prohibited (and ordered to phase out) in 2015 due to concerns about ozone depletion.
