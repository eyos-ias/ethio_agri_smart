When growing Date palm for fruit, a high-phosphorus organic fertilizer such as mushroom compost,, bone meal and poultry manure supports the development of delicious and well-formed fruits. Provide higher nitrogen and phospherus fertilizer to young Date palm to support strong leaf and root development for future growth.
To fertilize your date palm, manure makes an excellent option. If you'd rather use packaged fertilizer, specialty palm tree fertilizer is recommended. Apply fertilizer following label instructions during the late winter or early spring to prep the tree for its flower and fruit production in the coming months.
