Because they are native to hot climates, date palms do not require much water during the winter months. You may only need to water it once or twice a month during cold weather. However, in hot weather a single plant may consume up to 300 liters of water a day.
During spring and summer, when this plant is in its most active growth stage, you should plan to give it water about once per week, altering that rate slightly in the case of extreme heat. During the late fall and winter, the growth of your Date palm will slow, which means it will need less water.
