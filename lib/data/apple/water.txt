Water \n Apple tree water requirements depend on rainfall. In general, for an established tree, you won't need to water it unless you are not getting much rain or there is a particularly dry spell or even drought. About an inch (2.5 cm.) or so of rainfall every week to ten days is adequate for most apple trees.\n
