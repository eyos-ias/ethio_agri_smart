Pruning
What is pruning in Apple?
We prune apple trees for four main reasons. First, to make the tree easy to maintain and harvest by controlling the height and shape. Secondly, to maintain a healthy tree by removing dead, diseased or damaged wood. Thirdly, to improve air circulation which reduces pests and diseases.

What is the best time to prune apple trees?
Spring

PROCESS 
Prune out strong shoots growing towards the centre. You can leave weaker shoots (up to 20cm/8in long) unpruned. Look for any downward-growing branches low on the tree that receive little light and could cause an obstruction. Prune to a more upward-growing branch or back to the main trunk.
