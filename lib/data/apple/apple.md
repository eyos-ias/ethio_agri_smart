# What's an Apple?
An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree Malus domestica. Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.

# How grow an Apple? 
1.  Choosing the Right Variety: Start by selecting an apple variety suitable for your climate zone. Consider factors such as taste, texture, and whether you prefer dessert apples or cooking apples. 
 2.  Planting Location: Apple trees need a sunny location with well-drained soil. The soil should have a slightly acidic to neutral pH. Test the soil and make amendments if necessary before planting.
 3.  Planting Process: Dig a hole that is wide and deep enough to accommodate the tree's roots. Place the tree in the hole and spread out the roots carefully. Backfill the hole with soil, firming it gently around the roots. Ensure that the graft union (the swollen area where the cultivar is grafted onto the rootstock) is above the soil level. 
  4.  Watering and Mulching: Water the newly planted tree thoroughly and regularly during the first growing season. Mulching around the base of the tree with organic material like wood chips or straw helps retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. 
  5.  Pruning and Training: Pruning is important for managing the shape, size, and productivity of the tree. Prune during the dormant season, removing dead, damaged, or crossing branches. 
   6.  Fertilizing: Apple trees benefit from regular fertilization. Apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring and late fall, following the instructions on the product packaging. 
   7.  Pest and Disease Management: Monitor your apple tree for common pests like aphids, codling moths, or apple maggots, and implement appropriate control measures if necessary. Organic approaches like maintaining good tree hygiene, promoting biodiversity, and using biological controls are often preferred. 
 8.  Harvesting: Apples typically ripen in late summer or fall, depending on the variety. Harvest the fruit when it reaches its proper maturity stage by gently twisting it or lifting and testing for easy separation.
# Light:
Apple trees need full sun to grow properly and produce fruit. This level of exposure means the tree will see at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight each day. Anything less than this will result in poor fruit yields or a lack of fruit entirely.
# Soil: 
 Apples grow best on a well-drained, loam soils having a depth of 45 cm and a pH range of pH 5.5-6.5. The soil should be free from hard substrata and water-logged conditions. Soils with heavy clay or compact subsoil are to be avoided.
 # Water:
  Apple tree water requirements depend on rainfall. In general, for an established tree, you won't need to water it unless you are not getting much rain or there is a particularly dry spell or even drought. About an inch (2.5 cm.) or so of rainfall every week to ten days is adequate for most apple trees.
  # Temperature and Humidity: 
  Apples are best stored at 30°- 32°F, with a relative humidity of 90 percent and some air circulation. These conditions provide the greatest delay in the normal ripen- ing and aging process of the fruit.
 # Fertilizers:  
 Experts recommend fertilizing your apple tree right after you plant it, and then a second time in early summer. During the second year, experts suggest fertilizing once in early spring, and a second time in early summer. Fertilize mature apple trees once a year during the spring. Apple trees mainly prefer high nitrogen fertilizer. Composted chicken manure, blood, soybean, cottonseed, and feather are excellent organic nitrogen sources. Organic fertilizers provide the Apple trees with the nutrients they need to grow healthy Apples and grow stronger.
# PESTS: 
The common pests of Apple are: maggot flies, plum curculio, and codling moth.
# PESTICIDES:
 The best way to control pests in Apple is while those pests are mating and looking for potential egg-laying sites, so during this period we can use pesticides like: \n Chlorantrani liprole  41.2% \n Acetamiprid. 28.7%\n Lmidacloprid 20.2% \n Carbendazlm(MBC) 17.3%
 # Herbs:
 Some common types of herbs associated with apple flavors include cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, allspice, cardamom, and rosemary. These herbs can be used to enhance the taste of apples in various dishes and beverages.
 # Herbicides:
 Some common herbicides used in apple orchards include:

1. Glyphosate: This broad-spectrum herbicide is commonly used to control a wide range of weeds in apple orchards.

2. 2,4-D: This selective herbicide is effective against broadleaf weeds and is often used in combination with other herbicides for weed control in apple orchards.

3. Dicamba: Another selective herbicide, dicamba is used to control broadleaf weeds in apple orchards.

4. Atrazine: This herbicide is primarily used to control grassy weeds in apple orchards.

5. Simazine: Similar to atrazine, simazine is also used for controlling grassy weeds in apple orchards.

It is important to note that the use of herbicides should be done following proper guidelines and regulations to ensure the safety of the environment and human health.
# Toxicity: 
Apple flesh and peel are very healthful and pose no risks. Yet chewed or crushed apple seeds release small amounts of cyanide, which is highly toxic.
# Harvesting: 
The fruits mature within 130-150 days after the full bloom stage depending upon the variety grown. The ripening of fruits is associated with the change in colour, texture, quality and the development of the characteristic flavour. The fruits at the time of harvest should be uniform, firm and crisp.
# Pruning: 
Pruning What is pruning in Apple?\n We prune apple trees for four main reasons. First, to make the tree easy to maintain and harvest by controlling the height and shape. Secondly, to maintain a healthy tree by removing dead, diseased or damaged wood. Thirdly, to improve air circulation which reduces pests and diseases.\n What is the best time to prune apple trees? Spring\n PROCESS \n Prune out strong shoots growing towards the centre. You can leave weaker shoots (up to 20cm/8in long) unpruned. Look for any downward-growing branches low on the tree that receive little light and could cause an obstruction. Prune to a more upward-growing branch or back to the main trunk.
# Crop Distance:
The required distance for apple trees can vary depending on the specific variety and rootstock being used, as well as the desired growth habit (e.g., dwarf, semi-dwarf, standard). However, a general guideline for spacing apple trees is typically around 12 to 15 feet (3.6 to 4.5 meters) between trees within a row and 18 to 20 feet (5.4 to 6 meters) between rows. This spacing allows for proper air circulation, sunlight exposure, and room for the trees to grow and develop their root systems without overcrowding. It is always recommended to consult with local agricultural extension services or experts for specific recommendations based on your location and apple tree variety.
